<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">CHAPTER I</span>
<br />THE WHISPER FROM AFAR</h2>
<p>Curlie Carson sat before an alcohol stove.
Above and on all sides of him were the white
walls of a tent. The constant bulging and
sagging of these walls, the creak and snap of
ropes, told that outside a gale was blowing.
Beneath Curlie was a roll of deerskin and beneath
that was ice; a glacier, the Valdez Glacier.
They were a half day&rsquo;s journey from the city
of Valdez. Straight up the frowning blue-black
wall of ice they had made their way until darkness
had closed in upon them and a steep cliff
of ice had appeared before them.</p>
<p>In a corner of the tent, sprawled upon a deerskin
sleeping-bag, lay Joe Marion, Curlie&rsquo;s pal
in other adventures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky we&rsquo;ve got these sleeping-bags,&rdquo; Joe
drawled. &ldquo;Even then I don&rsquo;t see how a fellow&rsquo;s
going to keep warm, sleeping right out
here on the ice with the wind singing around
under the tent.&rdquo; He shivered as he drew his
mackinaw more closely about him.</p>
<p>Curlie said nothing. If you have read the
other book telling of Curlie&rsquo;s adventures, &ldquo;Curlie
Carson Listens In,&rdquo; you scarcely need be told
that Curlie Carson is a boy employed by the
United States Bureau of Secret Service of the
Air, a boy who has the most perfect pair of
radio ears of any person known to the service.</p>
<p>In that other adventure which had taken him
on a wild chase over the ocean in a pleasure
yacht, he had had many narrow escapes, but
this new bit of service which had been entrusted
to him promised to be even more exciting and
hazardous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>He had been sent in search of a man who
apparently was bent on destroying the usefulness
of the radiophone in Alaska; his particular
desire seeming to be to imperil the life of
Munson, a great Arctic explorer, by interrupting
his radiophone messages. This man was
known to be possessed of abundant resources,
to be powerful and dangerous. He had a perfect
knowledge of all matters pertaining to the
radiophone and was possessed of a splendidly
equipped sending and receiving set. By moving
this set about from place to place, he had succeeded
in eluding every government operator
sent out to silence him. Already he had
done incalculable damage by breaking in upon
government messages and upon private ones as
well.</p>
<p>Just at this moment, Curlie sat cross-legged
upon his sleeping-bag. With head and shoulders
drooping far forward, as if weighed down
by the radiophone receiver which was clamped
upon his ears, he appeared half asleep. Yet
every now and again his slim, tapered fingers
shot out to give the coil aerial which hung
suspended from the ridge pole of the tent a
slight turn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how we are going to get the
rest of the way over this glacier!&rdquo; grumbled
Joe. &ldquo;That wall looks straight up; slick as
glass, too. How y&rsquo; ever goin&rsquo; to get three
sleds and eight hundred pounds of junk up
there? Ought to have taken the lower trail.
What if it is three times as far? Good trail
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to Jennings,&rdquo; murmured Curlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Jennings!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe. &ldquo;Mebby
he doesn&rsquo;t know so much. He&rsquo;s been gone too
long already. What&rsquo;s that package he took with
him? Gave us the slip already, maybe.
Might be just a frame-up to keep us from
making good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jennings looks all right to me,&rdquo; persisted
Curlie.</p>
<p>He gave the aerial another turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway!&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh&rdquo;&mdash;Curlie held up a warning finger.
His nose was wiggling like a rabbit&rsquo;s when he
eats clover. Joe knew what that meant; Curlie
was getting something from the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>Curlie started as the first word came to him&mdash;a
whisper. He had heard that whisper many
times before. For many days it had been silent.
Now she was speaking to him again, that
mysterious phantom girl of the air.</p>
<p>As he eagerly pressed the receivers to his
ears, he caught, faint as if coming from afar,
yet very distinctly, the whispered words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello - Curlie - I - wonder - if - you - are -
listening - in - to-night. You - are - on - your -
way - north. I - wanted - to - tell - you - the -
man - you - are - after - is - on - the - Yukon -
Trail - coming - south. He - started - yesterday.
You - may - meet - him - Curlie - but - be -
careful. It - is - big - Curlie - and - awful -
awful - dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cold beads of perspiration stood out upon the
tip of Curlie&rsquo;s nose as the whisper ceased.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>He had measured the distance. The girl was
a thousand miles away to the north. So that
was it? The man he had been sent to track
down by means of the radio-compass was coming
south over the trail. They would meet.
He wondered how and where. There were
wild, desolate stretches of tundra and forest on
that trail. Inhabited only by Indians and
wolves, these offered fitting background for a
tragedy. Whose tragedy would it be?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might wait for him,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;but,
no, that wouldn&rsquo;t do. He might turn back.
Then all that time would be lost. No, we must
press on. We must get off this glacier at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of his optimism, this glacier bothered
him. He had taken this trail at the suggestion
of Jennings, a man who had gone over the trail
during the gold rush of &rsquo;98 and who had
offered to go with them now without pay. He
had, as he expressed it, been called back by the
&ldquo;lure of the North,&rdquo; and must answer the
call. Curlie had decided to accept his assistance
and advice. Now he wrinkled his brow in
thought. Had he made a mistake in the very
beginning?</p>
<p>Just then, as if in answer to his question,
Jennings, a short, broad-shouldered person with
keen, deep-set blue eyes and drooping moustache,
parted the tent-flaps and entered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What? Not turned in yet?&rdquo; His eyes
showed surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had to see that you got back safe,&rdquo; smiled
Curlie. He made a mental note of the fact
that Jennings had not brought back the package
he had carried away. Only a light axe swung
at his belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s kind and thoughtful,&rdquo; said Jennings.
&ldquo;But we&rsquo;d better get into them sleepin&rsquo;-bags
pronto. Got a good stiff day to-morrow.
Make good progress too or I&rsquo;m no sourdough-musher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, Curlie having buried
himself deep in the hairy depths of his sleeping-bag,
had given himself over to a few moments
of thought before the drowsy quiet of the tent
lulled him to repose.</p>
<p>The sleeping-bags, in spite of Joe&rsquo;s forebodings,
proved to be all that one might ask.
With nothing but a square of canvas between
his sleeping-bag and the ice, and with the
temperature at thirty below, clad only in his
pajamas Curlie felt quite as comfortable as he
might have felt in his own bed back home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful thing, these bags,&rdquo; he thought
dreamily. His thought about the future, the day
just before him, was not quite so reassuring.
They had come to ridges of ice on the surface
of the glacier just at nightfall. There were
many of these ridges. Dogs without sleds
could climb them, but up their slopes they
could not pull a pound. A man climbed them
with difficulty. His feet slipping at every attempted
step, he was constantly in danger of
being dashed to the bottom. How were they to
pack eight hundred pounds of equipment and
supplies over these seemingly unsurmountable
barriers?</p>
<p>Yet he dreaded to think of turning back.
That meant four days of travel to reach a point
which, straight over the glacier, was but twenty
miles before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, well,&rdquo; he sighed at last, &ldquo;let to-morrow
take care of itself. Perhaps Jennings really
knows a way. He doesn&rsquo;t look like a four-flusher.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>With that his mind turned for a moment to
the girl, the Whisperer. Though he had never
seen her, he had come to think of this Whisperer
as a real person. And indeed she must be,
for, times without number, in the Secret Tower
Room back there in the city, in the wireless
room on the yacht, in the tent on the trail, her
whisper had come to him. Always it told of
the doings of one man, the man he had been sent after.
But what sort of person? He had pictured her
to himself as a small, dark, vivacious girl with
snapping black eyes. Yet that was only a piece
of fancy. He knew nothing about her save the
fact that she seemed always near the man he
now was seeking. He wondered vaguely now
whether he would meet her upon this trip. He
tried to imagine the cabin, the lonely trail or
the deep forest of the north where he might
meet her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably never will,&rdquo; he told himself at
last. &ldquo;Probably will always be just a whisper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of his revery he fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />ON ARCTIC FEATHERS</h2>
<p>A tardy dawn had scarcely come creeping
over the surface of the glacier when they broke
camp. Having breakfasted heartily on sourdough
flapjacks, warmed-over baked beans and
coffee, they were ready for anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sleep in a better bed to-night,&rdquo; remarked
Jennings as he rolled up the canvas
floor to their tent and threw it on his sled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be warmer,&rdquo; said Curlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but softer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer-o,&rdquo; shouted Joe, &ldquo;that sounds good
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Jennings, producing from the
depths of his pack two small double pulleys and
a coil of rope, &ldquo;the next thing is to get over
the ridges. Have to use block and tackle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds all right,&rdquo; smiled Curlie, &ldquo;but
how you going to hitch a block to a smooth
surface of ice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it to me,&rdquo; laughed the miner. &ldquo;Between
four and five thousand of us went over
this glacier in &rsquo;98. Had mighty few dogs and
pulled 1400 pounds of outfit apiece too. That
was tough sledding. Didn&rsquo;t make a thousand
feet progress in a day sometimes. Three of
our crowd never did get over; froze to death
right here on the glacier. But I tell you,&rdquo; he
exclaimed suddenly, &ldquo;those were the days!
Those were the men! It&rsquo;s always the bravest
and the best that go first in a rush like that.
The cheap, the idle, the crooked ones come later
to live off the gains of those who dared much
in the beginning.&rdquo; Having ended this little
oration, he got down to business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys string the rope through those
blocks. When you get that done, throw me up
one of the blocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;better strap these
on your shoes. They&rsquo;ll help you a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>The things he threw at their feet were made
of steel and leather. When they were strapped
upon the soles of one&rsquo;s shoes they transformed
their plain, heavy felt-lined shoes into something
resembling baseball shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great stuff!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe, driving the
sharp steel barbs beneath the balls of his feet
into the ice. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t slip in these if you
tried to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later they tossed one of the blocks
into which the rope had been threaded up to
Jennings on the icy ridge above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he sang out a moment later.
&ldquo;Hitch the other block to the sled and heave
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much to the surprise of the boys, when they
pulled at the rope, the block, out of sight on
the ridge above, held firm, and the sled climbed
slowly up the almost perpendicular bank. A
moment later, they saw Jennings drag the sled
to a safe position on the icy bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does he do it?&rdquo; whispered Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got me,&rdquo; Curlie whispered back. &ldquo;He
surely couldn&rsquo;t hold it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say not! Took both of us to pull it up
and we had the advantage of the blocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; came from above as a block
glided back to them, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have the next one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the three sleds were upon the bench
and the dogs had been induced to follow, the
boys climbed up, eager to discover the miner&rsquo;s
secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe. &ldquo;Only a stake in
the ice. Who could have left it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was staring at a stout stake which stuck
ten inches above the surface of the ice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody. I put it there,&rdquo; Jennings smiled.
Then, seeing their look of incredulity, he went
on, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll remember I left the cabin last night
with a package under my arm. Also, you will
remember that I melted a bucket of snow water
while supper was cooking. In the bundle there
was nothing but stout stakes; a dozen of them.
You&rsquo;ll find them up the glacier, all frozen in.
All I had to do was to chip a hole in the ice,
then thrust in a stake. After that I filled the
hole full of snow, then poured water over it.
The snow and water froze together almost instantly
and here we have our stakes. We&rsquo;ll
have lunch on the other side of the ridge and
to-night we will sleep in a spruce forest. We
shall then have gained a full two days on our
journey. With the trail in its present condition
we could not have made the journey
over the roundabout valley in less than four
days and even then we would have worn down
our dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When, a few hours later, all the miner&rsquo;s
prophecies had been fulfilled and the boys were
preparing the second night&rsquo;s camp, they were
enthusiastic in their praise of their new-found
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night,&rdquo; smiled the miner, &ldquo;we will sleep
on a bed of Arctic feathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arctic feathers!&rdquo; exclaimed Curlie in surprise.
&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jennings studied the shapely spruce trees
which towered about them on every side. Then
he allowed his eyes to wander over the surface
of the earth&rsquo;s two-foot-thick mantle of snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good place,&rdquo; he pointed at a
smooth spot which was surrounded by trees.
&ldquo;First we&rsquo;ll tramp down the snow. No need
of shoveling it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once they set to work packing down a
square of snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well start right,&rdquo; said the miner.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going into a land of long nights. Fairly
long now but they&rsquo;ll get much longer. Get to
be twenty hours. If we start making camp
right we&rsquo;ll have all the comforts of home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;guess that&rsquo;ll do.
Now we&rsquo;ll divide up the work and make the
jobs regular; each fellow do the same thing
every night. System, that&rsquo;s what you need
on the trail, as well as in business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to Joe he said: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a likely
looking tree right there. Cut it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t burn; it&rsquo;s green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said it would?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe grinned as he seized an axe to drive it
into the thick bark of the tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a dead tree for you, Curlie,&rdquo; said
the miner. &ldquo;Get it down and cut it into wood
for the Yukon stove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to the camp kit, he was soon at
work straightening out the tent, which had
collected dampness from the previous night and
was frozen stiff in spots.</p>
<p>He spread it over their tent-site and set it
up as best he could. Then, crawling inside, he
set up the sheet-iron stove and started a fire.
As the tent, warmed by the fire, began to
soften, he gradually drew it into its accustomed
shape.</p>
<p>In the meantime each boy had felled his tree
and had trimmed it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Joe,&rdquo; said the veteran camper, &ldquo;cut
your tree into lengths to go across each side of
our tent and chop the first six inches of each
end half off as if you were building a log
house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>When this had been accomplished, he assisted
Joe in placing the poles in a square about
the tent. He next drew the lower edges of the
tent out over the logs and packed snow over them
to the depth of several inches. After that he
spread a square of canvas as a floor to the
tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he sighed at last; &ldquo;won&rsquo;t any air
get into our tent to-night. Next thing is a
lot of spruce boughs. Cut &rsquo;em right off and
drag &rsquo;em inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the tent was packed half full of
boughs, he took out a large clasp knife and
began to clip off the small twigs on the branches.
The boys followed his example. In a few
moments the shorn branches were all outside
the tent and the canvas floor was buried ten
inches deep with spruce needles and fine twigs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the miner, &ldquo;the two of you
hold up the stove while I spread a canvas over
the whole of it and our camp is made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like an old-fashioned feather bed!&rdquo;
exclaimed Joe, as he bounced down upon the
springy bed of twigs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; smiled the miner. &ldquo;Those are
Arctic feathers. If we take time to make a
camp like this every night, we&rsquo;ll get a lot of
comfort out of it and be all the better fitted
for the trail. I&rsquo;ll go out and set up a shelter
for the dogs while you boys get supper, then
we&rsquo;ll be through for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />A CLUE</h2>
<p>After a hearty supper, Curlie brought forth
his instruments and carefully wound his coil
aerial.</p>
<p>The miner watched him for a long time in
silence. Having lived in out-of-the-way places,
he had learned nothing of this wonderful new
invention, the radiophone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to tell me,&rdquo; he broke
forth at last, &ldquo;that you can hear folks talk with
just that outfit, no wires at all, and them fifty
miles away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; smiled Curlie, &ldquo;five hundred miles or
a thousand if you like. Almost any distance
when conditions are right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Dropping back upon his sleeping-bag the
miner watched with increasing interest. It
was evident that he found the thing hard to
believe and that at the same time he did not
wish to doubt the word of a boy who had
never told him a lie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; said Curlie, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s something brand
new. I think it&rsquo;s going to help us a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He placed a small instrument on top of a
metal box, then connected it by a tube to a loud-speaker.
After that he tuned in on the 750
meter wave length and spoke a few words into
his transmitter. Having done this, he settled
back as if to await an answer.</p>
<p>Presently a loud jumble of sound, resembling
nothing quite so much as a flock of crows
fighting over a carcass, began coming forth
from the loud-speaker.</p>
<p>Joe Marion&rsquo;s brow wrinkled. At the end
of three seconds he exploded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tune her up, why don&rsquo;t you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie grinned, but did not move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use letting it go on like that,&rdquo; expostulated
Joe, making a move to take a hand
in the business. &ldquo;He might be sending something
important.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; said Curlie, pushing his companion
back to his seat. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s saying something
mighty important. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t change
it. I told you I had something new. Can&rsquo;t
you wait to see it tried out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sinking back into his place, Joe listened to
the strange clack-clack in silence.</p>
<p>A few seconds later the sounds ceased.
Quickly removing a small instrument and disconnecting
the tube from the loud-speaker,
Curlie tuned in on 350 and, a moment later,
they were listening to a concert which was
being broadcasted somewhere on the Pacific
Coast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that that thing is
a phonograph?&rdquo; said Jennings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Curlie, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. That music
comes to us over five hundred miles of space,
perhaps a thousand; Seattle, Vancouver, San
Francisco, I don&rsquo;t know which.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the miner was silent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>Removing a small disc from the instrument
which had produced the strange jumble of
sounds, Curlie slipped it upon a second instrument
which resembled a small phonograph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen to this,&rdquo; he said to Joe, as he
shut off the radiophone.</p>
<p>From the phonograph-like instrument there
came first a grating sound, then in a somewhat
metallic but very distinct tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valdez speaking. Your man is still active.
Doing much damage in air. Last night interrupted
an important U. S. army order. Seemed
nearer. Appears to be moving toward us. Location
somewhere south of Fort Yukon. Advise
speed and caution. N. T. S.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, what do you think of that!&rdquo;
exclaimed Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Curlie, &ldquo;that we have put
one over on our old friend up north there who
persists in raising hob in the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he went on more soberly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
a very recent invention. You slip a little affair
on your sending instrument, which tears your
tones all into little bits and sends them out as
so much mental mince pie. But this little instrument
here straightens them out for the person
at the other end and gives them to him just
as they have been spoken. I feel sure that
the man we are after does not possess one of the
outfits. That means that we may speak with
Valdez at any time without fear of detection.
All that an outside party gets is a jumble of
sounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we ever get separated on the trail we
may speak to one another in the same way.
You have that small, reserve sending and receiving
set on your sled and I am going to
give you a set of these new instruments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once more,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;I want to state
that it is my belief that if you keep your little
radiophone dry and tuned up, it will help you
out of any dangerous position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had they known under what strange circumstances
this belief would be tried in the days
to come and on this very trip, the two boys
might not have laughed quite so merrily as
Curlie again threw on the radiophone and they
listened to jazz being broadcasted from Seattle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>Joe, tired out from the day&rsquo;s struggle over the
glacier, feeling the cozy warmth of the fire,
stretched himself out on his sleeping-bag and fell
at once into a drowsy slumber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Curlie, noting the eager manner
in which Jennings listened to the bits of
music and gossip which drifted in from the
air, &ldquo;you listen with this.&rdquo; He snapped a
receiver over the miner&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to
shut off that loud-speaker. Want to listen in
and see what I can catch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time he listened on short wave lengths
for his friend, the Whisperer. At last, having
given that up, he tuned in on long wave lengths
and at once began picking up something.</p>
<p>Having tuned his instrument accurately and
adjusted his coil aerial, he succeeded in listening
in in a very satisfactory matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big business,&rdquo; he whispered to himself.
&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if that was a clue.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>It was indeed big business that was flashing
through the air that night. It was the report of
a government official, the announcement of the
securing of sufficient evidence at Nome, Alaska,
to convict a bold band of smugglers who had
been carrying valuable jewels, taken from rich
families in Russia, into America by way of
Alaska. These smugglers had escaped detection
for some time by traveling in native skin-boats
across Behring Straits. In some way,
Curlie could hardly make out how, the great
explorer Munson had been of assistance to the
government in bringing these men to justice.
Because of this service the government was
instructing all its officials, especially wireless
operators, to lend every assistance possible to
Munson in his dash to the Pole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see how a fellow three thousand miles
away can help an explorer reach the Pole,&rdquo;
Curlie told himself, &ldquo;but I suppose there must
be a way&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thoughts were cut short by an interruption
to the message. Someone with a powerful
sending set had cut loose into the air with
his sparker. The result was utter bedlam of
the air. Not one word could be recognized.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man,&rdquo; Curlie breathed excitedly,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s the fellow I&rsquo;m after! Now for his location.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His fingers moved rapidly from instrument
to pencil and paper, then back to instrument
again. There was a look of tense excitement on
his face, such a look as comes upon the hunter
as he sights a moose not a hundred yards away.
Curlie was a born hunter, a hunter of the air.
He had got scent of a prey, a dangerous prey,
and was at this moment hunting him down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he breathed as the bedlam ceased,
and he drew the receiver from his head. &ldquo;I
know where you are, at least. You&rsquo;re moving. I
wonder if we&rsquo;ll meet and when. I know what
I&rsquo;m going to say to you when we meet. Wonder
if you know what you&rsquo;re going to say to me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>Having packed his instruments away, he
stretched himself out before the fire to think.
Events were moving on apace. It looked as if
his journey would be shorter than he had at first
believed it would be. You never could tell,
though. He thought for the hundredth time of
the Whisperer; wondered who she really was
and why her whisper had been missing to-night.</p>
<p>At last, reaching over to Joe, he shook him
into wakefulness and told him to turn in. Having
undressed, he slipped on a suit of pajamas,
crept into his sleeping-bag and was soon fast
asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />JOE MISSING</h2>
<p>Curlie Carson was worried. As he sat on
his rolled-up sleeping-bag in the tent which had
been set with the usual care for a night&rsquo;s comfort,
his fingers drummed incessantly on the
box which held his three-stage amplifier, while
he muttered ever now and again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish he&rsquo;d come. I don&rsquo;t like the looks of
it. What&rsquo;s keeping him? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like
to know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>Joe was three hours overdue. After many
days of travel they had made their way far
into the interior of Alaska, well away toward
the Yukon. Day by day they had broken trail
for their dogs and day by day moved forward.
At first the trail had been hard-packed from
many dog teams passing from village to village.
But as they pushed farther and farther into the
wilderness these villages had vanished. Towns
that were towns only in name greeted them
now as they advanced. An Indian&rsquo;s hovel here,
the shack of a long-bearded patriarch of a
miner there, that was all.</p>
<p>Snow had fallen in abundance. They were
obliged to break every foot of trail before their
dog teams.</p>
<p>Food was scarce. The question of feeding
their dogs had become a problem. Then, only
this very afternoon an Indian had told of a
cache of caribou meat some ten miles away in
the forest. If they would wait for him to
bring it, they would have fine fresh meat in
abundance.</p>
<p>The boys had debated the question. They
were eager to go forward. A whispered message
of the night before had led them to believe
that their quest was nearing its end; that the
man they sought was not far before them on
the trail; yet the dogs must be fed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>It had been decided at last that Joe Marion
with an all but empty sled should await the
supply of meat, while the others pressed on
breaking the trail until near nightfall, when
they would make camp and await his arrival.</p>
<p>Curlie and Jennings had carried out their
part of the program, but when he should have
arrived Joe had not appeared, rounding the
clump of spruce trees to the south of them.</p>
<p>After an hour of anxious waiting, Jennings,
taking his rifle, had gone out to search for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May have lost his way,&rdquo; he had commented.</p>
<p>Curlie had remained to listen in on his radiophone.
Joe carried with him, attached to his
sled, a complete sending and receiving set. In
time of trouble the first thing he would think
of would be getting off a radiophone message to
his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought to be getting something,&rdquo; Curlie
mumbled. &ldquo;I wonder what could have happened?
I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>He paused for reflection. Night by night as
he had sat upon his sleeping-bag, listening in,
strange messages had come to him from the sky.
Now the rude interference of the unknown man
who had been tearing up the traffic of the air
told Curlie that they were coming closer to one
another, and now the whisper of the girl, that
ghostlike creature who appeared to haunt the
track of the lawbreaker, told Curlie of the day
fast approaching when he and the outlaw of the
air must meet face to face. At such times he
had wondered if he should then meet the girl
as well as the man.</p>
<p>On the previous night the whisper had informed
him that they were but seventy-five
miles apart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming, coming,&rdquo; Curlie had whispered to
himself.</p>
<p>The trail had been heavy. They had made
but fifteen miles. What of the stranger? How
far had he come?</p>
<p>Curlie&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat at the realization
that he must be very near at hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>At the same time there came a disturbing
question. Had this man of evil intentions
somehow stolen a march on them? Had he
been in league with the Indian who had claimed
to possess a supply of caribou meat? Had
this been but a ruse to get them separated?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it was, it&rsquo;s been a complete success,&rdquo;
he exclaimed. &ldquo;Three of us and not one
of us knows where the others are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning, he reached for a box-magazine
rifle. After examining the clip in the chamber,
he slipped three other loaded ones in his pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can never tell,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;you
sure can not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A great silence hovered over the forest which
bounded the banks of the Tanana River. Such
silences existed in these Arctic wilds as Curlie
had never before experienced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairly spooky,&rdquo; he whispered to himself.
&ldquo;Wish I could hear something&mdash;wind in the
treetops, even. But there&rsquo;s not a breath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The forest lay all about him. Everywhere
the ground was buried in two feet of snow.
Muffled footsteps might at this moment be approaching
the camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>At last, unable to bear it longer, he snapped
off the radiophone for a moment to adjust a
smaller set and tune it to 200, the wave length
he and Joe had agreed to use if in distress.</p>
<p>When this smaller set had been called into
action, he tuned the larger set to longer wave
lengths. He hoped to catch some sound from
the air which might relieve the awful silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful thing this radiophone,&rdquo; he told
himself. &ldquo;Great boon to the Arctic. Think of
the trader, the trapper, the gold hunter alone in
his cabin, tired of the sound of his own voice and
that of his dog. Think of being able to tune in
on his radio and bring down snatches of song,
of instrumental music and of ordinary conversation,
right out of the air&mdash;some young girl
sending her lover a good-night kiss, for
instance,&rdquo; he chuckled to himself. &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>He paused abruptly. He was getting something
on the long wave lengths. Faint, indistinct
at first came the message. Yet he caught it
clearly. His nerves tingled as he listened.
It was Munson, the great Arctic explorer. He
was attempting to inform the outside world,
especially the men who had financed his expedition,
of his plans. He had established a
large supply station on Flaxman Island; then
he had pushed fearlessly out through the floes
toward the Pole. His ship was strongly built,
with an extra covering of iron-wood on its
keel. Its engines were powerful. He would
go as far as the steamer would carry him, then
he would hop off in an airplane and attempt
the Pole. He was supplied with three airplanes.
In these, if his ship should be wrecked, he would
be able to carry his entire company and crew
to the supply house on Flaxman Island.</p>
<p>This brief report was followed by a personal
message to his wife, then the air was once more
clear. The old, monotonous silence settled down
upon Curlie&rsquo;s little world. During all the time
he had listened in, his fingers had been flying
across a sheet of paper. He had written down
the message. It was within the realm of possibility
that he was the only operator who had
got it. In that case it would be his duty to
relay it to those for whom it was intended.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>During all this time one question had been
revolving in his mind: Why had not the man
he sought, the outlaw of the air, broken in on
this message? He had been informed that this
man had taken delight in breaking up Munson&rsquo;s
communications. Why then this silence? Could
it be that he himself was out scouting around,
trying to ambush Joe and Jennings and in time
even Curlie himself? Or was he merely afraid
of being detected at this time?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; said Curlie to himself, &ldquo;there
was something about that message which interested
him. In that case he would want to
hear to the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly his hand made a clutch at his
rifle. What was that? Had he caught the
sound of a footstep or was it merely a white owl
flapping his wings? He sat there listening,
scarcely breathing, awaiting he hardly knew
what. And, at this moment, on the 200 meter
wave lengths a message came to his waiting
ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />DANGEROUS BUSINESS</h2>
<p>The Indian who had promised to provide the
boys with caribou meat had not deceived them.
At the appointed hour he had returned with an
abundant supply.</p>
<p>In his eagerness to secure provisions for a
long lap of the journey, Joe had piled his sled
high with meat. In doing this he had made a
mistake, but this he did not know at the time.</p>
<p>Having paid the Indian, he lashed his rifle to
the top of the load, and, shouting to his dogs,
went racing away after his companions.</p>
<p>The short day was nearing its close when, on
passing a turn in the trail, Joe found himself
swinging out of the forest into an open stretch
of wild meadow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>He had hardly made a hundred rods of this
open trail when he heard a sharp howl which
came from the edge of the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolves!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Caught the scent
of this meat. Indians say it has been a bad
winter for wolves. Starving, I guess. Well,
we&rsquo;ll show those boys our heels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching out to the sled as he traveled forward,
he unlashed his rifle and threw it across
his arm. As he did so, he caught his breath.
There were, he suddenly remembered, but four
cartridges in the rifle and none on the sled.
Their supply of ammunition was on Curlie&rsquo;s
sled.</p>
<p>Shouting at the dogs, he gripped the handle of
the sled with one hand and with the rifle poised
in the other, went pit-patting along over the
trail.</p>
<p>He had reached the center of the open space
and was hoping to arrive at the forest soon and
find the others encamped there, when tragedy
suddenly descended upon him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>A dull crash was followed by a sickening
thud. The sled, having been twisted sideways
in crossing a dry ravine, had crumpled down.
Springing forward, the boy found that all the
lashings and braces of one runner were torn
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smashed beyond repair,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;Now how am I going to get that meat to
camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought of unhitching the dogs and of
clinging to the main draw rope as he raced
away to his friends for aid. This thought was
speedily banished when a dismal, long-drawn
howl came from the edge of the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolves,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d eat it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought of making the canvas covering
of his pack into an improvised sled and placing
the meat upon it, of hitching the dogs to that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe they could haul it,&rdquo; he decided.
&ldquo;The trail&rsquo;s too narrow. Snow on sides
is too deep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again there came the dismal howl. This time
it was followed by a yap-yap-yap. To the boy&rsquo;s
consternation, this yapping was answered from
a dozen points at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lot of them out there. Gaunt, hungry
beasts. Dangerous, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he thought of the four cartridges.
They were not enough. He might be obliged to
cut his team loose and make a dash for it.</p>
<p>The dogs heard the challenging call from the
wild creatures of the forest and bunched together
as if for defense. Their manes stood
straight up. The leader, a part-hound, was
growling in a low tone, as if talking to himself.</p>
<p>This team of five dogs which Joe drove was
a pick-up team. Besides the part-hound leader,
there was one huskie and three dogs of uncertain
breed. The huskie&rsquo;s team mate, Sport,
was slight of build and inclined to shirk. The
two &ldquo;wheel-horses&rdquo; were short, stocky fellows
who worked well in traces and showed signs of
being good fighters.</p>
<p>Like some scout preparing for an Indian attack,
Joe now loosened the dogs&rsquo; traces from the
sled. But that they might not rush out heedless
of danger to be cut up by the merciless fangs
of the wolves he chained each dog to the sled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Time enough to let you at them later,&rdquo; he
murmured. He felt a certain amount of security
in their companionship.</p>
<p>Just what he meant to do, he did not for
the moment know. Darkness had fallen. Like
twin glowworms, the eyes of the wolves shone
at the edge of the forest. Already some of
them were creeping out into the open. There
were a number of them; just how many he
could not tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one that sent out the call was probably
the daddy of a large family,&rdquo; he told himself,
&ldquo;and he&rsquo;s invited the whole family to a feast.
But,&rdquo; he said as he set his teeth hard, &ldquo;there
won&rsquo;t be any feast if I can help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaning his rifle against the sled, he dropped
his chin on his hands to lapse into deep thought.
Then suddenly he leaped into action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I think of that before?&rdquo; he exclaimed
as he tore at the wrappings of the sled.</p>
<p>He had thought of the radiophone equipment
packed away on his sled, the reserve outfit
which always rode there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I can only get it set up,&rdquo; he told himself,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be able to call Curlie. Then he and Jennings
will make a dash for it. With rifles and
plenty of ammunition they&rsquo;ll beat the wolves off.
We&rsquo;ll feed some of their carcasses to the dogs
and have that much more caribou meat for
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His fingers trembled as he unpacked the detector
and set it firmly upon the overturned
sled. He had caught the gleam of a pair of
flashing eyes much closer than he had thought
the wolves would dare to come. He had caught,
too, the ominous sound of chop-chopping jaws.
Pete, the huskie, was ki-yi-ing and straining at
his chain. Major, the dog who always guarded
the sled at night, was sending forth a low
rumbling challenge.</p>
<p>As Joe set his amplifier into position, he sent
a flash of light from his electric torch full upon
one of those gray beasts. The wolf, recoiling
as if shot by a rifle, doubled into a heap, then
sprang snarling away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>Joe laughed at this wild demonstration of
fear. The next instant his face sobered. He
was surprised at the size of these timber wolves
and at their gauntness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Starved to skin and bones. Ready for anything,&rdquo;
he muttered grimly as he set two jointed
poles straight up in the snow.</p>
<p>From the top of these poles hung suspended
his coil aerial. There remained but to connect
the batteries. He was bent over the sled, intent
upon making these connections secure, when
he was startled by a mad chop of jaws directly
behind him. The next instant there was a wild
whirling of legs and fur, as Major engaged a
wolf in combat.</p>
<p>Snatching his rifle, Joe stood ready to do
deadly execution once the combatants separated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But only four cartridges,&rdquo; he breathed,
&ldquo;and my call for help not yet sent.&rdquo; His heart
sank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />THE BATTLE CRY</h2>
<p>Even hampered as he was by the chain attached
to his collar, the faithful old watchdog
was more than a match for his lighter opponent.
Over and over they tumbled. Twice the chain,
tangling about the wolf&rsquo;s legs, seemed about to
make him prisoner. At last with a savage onslaught
Major leaped clean at the enemy&rsquo;s
throat. There followed a gurgling cough. For
a second the end seemed at hand. But the next
instant, Major&rsquo;s teeth lost their grip. The wolf,
feeling himself free, and having had quite
enough, slunk away into the shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well let him go,&rdquo; was the boy&rsquo;s
mental comment. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s well licked. He&rsquo;ll not
want to come back. Save my shots for those
who mix in next.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>In this, perhaps he made a mistake. Bleeding
from many wounds, the wolf carried a rank
scent of battle and blood back to his companions,
a scent more maddening than was that of the
frozen meat upon the sled. Hardly had he
disappeared into the darkness than there arose
from out that darkness a war song such as
Joe had never before given ear to, a song that
made his blood run cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a second to lose,&rdquo; he exclaimed as he
snapped the receiver over his head, threw on
the switch and pressed his lips to the transmitter.</p>
<p>He was talking on 200. &ldquo;Hello! Hello!
Curlie, you hear? Wolves. Six miles from
Indian&rsquo;s shack. Sled broken. Must fight for
life. Got four shots. Bring rifles. Come
quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eagerly he pressed the receivers to his ears.
Wildly his heart beat. It was a tense moment.
Would Curlie be listening in on 200? Would
the message carry? Would he respond?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>After a moment had elapsed, with the gleam
of eyes coming ever closer, he repeated his
message. Again he pressed the receivers to
his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t hear,&rdquo; he muttered half in despair.
&ldquo;Have to make a dash for it. Meat
might save us&mdash;might satisfy them. But
they&rsquo;re mad with the smell of fresh food.
They&rsquo;re&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A voice boomed in his ear. It was Curlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming,&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Hold fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Joe breathed as he snatched the receiver
from his head and clutched at his rifle,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as he said it, a flash from his electric
torch caught a huge fellow, the leader of the
pack, all but upon them. Like the other, he
doubled up and leaped away, but this only
made the boy understand that his position was
still perilous. Curlie had not told him how far
he was away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be at least five miles,&rdquo; he groaned.
&ldquo;Take him a half hour. Major, old boy, do
you think we can hold them?&rdquo; The answer
from the dog was a low, rumbling growl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>There was a deal of comfort to be obtained
from that growl. Heretofore Joe had thought
of these sled-dogs as mere beasts of burden;
thought of them as he might have thought of
horses or mules on the flat, sleepy, safe prairies
of the Mississippi valley. Now he found himself
regarding them as friends, as fellow warriors
engaged in a common business, the business
of protecting their lives against the onrush of
the enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some dogs you are,&rdquo; he murmured gratefully.
&ldquo;You not only pull a fellow&rsquo;s load for
him, but in time of danger you turn in and
fight for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew that if he came out of this combat
alive he would always cherish a feeling of loyal
friendship for these five companions in combat.</p>
<p>It was a tense moment. They were in a
tight place. A chill raced up his spine and his
knees trembled as he caught the gleam of new
pairs of eyes burning holes into the darkness.
Others had heard the blood-curdling war song
and had come to join in the battle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>The flash of the torch held the beasts at bay
for a time, but at last it only maddened them
as they pressed closer in.</p>
<p>Joe was in despair. Should he loose the
dogs? He scarcely dared. They would rush
out at those burning eyes and be destroyed.
Then he would be alone. And yet, if worse
came to worst, if the enemy rushed in, there
would not be time to loose them, and chained
as they were, the dogs would fight at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Curlie Carson was bounding
over the trail. Now he had covered a mile, now
two, now three. There were three miles more.
Panting, perspiring, staggering forward, now
tripping over a snow-covered bush, and now
falling over a log, he struggled on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he can&rsquo;t make it!&rdquo; Joe all but sobbed
as he counted the moments! &ldquo;Ah, here they
come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was time only to loose the chain of
Major before three gray streaks leaped at
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>Major met one and downed him. Ginger,
the hound leader, chained as he was, grappled
with a second. The third leaped at the boy&rsquo;s
throat. Just in time he threw up the rifle
barrel. Gripped in both his hands, it stopped
the beast. Kicking out with his right foot,
he sent him sprawling. The next instant the
rifle cracked. One shot gone, but an enemy
accounted for.</p>
<p>A fourth wolf sprang upon the gentle, inoffensive
Sport and bore him to the snow.</p>
<p>Leaping upon the sled, Joe stood ready to
sell his life as dearly as he might. Catching
the ki-yi of Pete, the huskie, he reached over
and unsnapped his chain, to see him leap at
the throat of the nearest enemy. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
coming, coming!&rdquo; Joe sang out.</p>
<p>All fear had left him now. He was in the
midst of a battle. That they would win that
battle he did not dream. Curlie could never
reach them in time. But, like Custer&rsquo;s men,
they would die game.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>Sport was down. Major was strangling the
life from a clawing wolf. Ginger was engaged
in an unfinished battle. Two wolves leaped at
the sled, one from either side. The rifle cracked.
A wolf leaped high and fell. The second sprang.
He was instantly met and borne to the snow
by Bones, the second &ldquo;wheel-horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now they came in a drove, five, six,
seven, gaunt gray beasts with chop-chopping
jaws.</p>
<p>With deliberate aim the boy dropped the foremost,
then the second. Then, calmly clubbing
his rifle, he waited.</p>
<p>The foremost wolf was not two yards from
the sled, when Joe was startled to hear a rifle
crack and see the wolf leap high in air. He
was astonished. Curlie could not possibly have
reached his objective in this time. Who was
this man, his deliverer? Leaning far forward,
he tried to peer into the darkness, as the rifle
cracked again and yet again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />REVENGE FOR A LOST COMRADE</h2>
<p>For a second, as he stood there on the sled,
with the big Arctic moon rising above the
forest, with the crack of the strange rifle, the
roar of dogs and the howl of wolves dinning in
his ears, Joe fancied himself acting a part in
the movies. It was too strange to seem real.</p>
<p>This lasted but a second; then, realizing that
the battle was more than half won but that some
of his dogs might be in danger, he sprang from
the sled. The next instant with the butt of his
rifle he crushed the skull of a wolf whose fangs
were tearing at the throat of a dog. The wolf,
crumpling over, lay quivering in death.</p>
<p>As he bent over the prostrate dog he saw
that it was Sport.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Frightened, bewildered, disheartened by the
crack-crack of the newcomer&rsquo;s rifle, the remnant
of the wolf-pack took to its heels. Soon save
for the growl and whine of dogs, silence reigned
in meadow and forest.</p>
<p>The man with the rifle stepped forward. To
Joe&rsquo;s surprise he saw that it was Jennings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! It&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did you think it might be?&rdquo; laughed
the miner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it might have been most anyone.
Might even have been the man Curlie&rsquo;s looking
for, the outlaw of the air. I thought you were
with Curlie. Curlie&rsquo;s coming&mdash;must be most
of the way here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Jennings quickly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better go
back and meet him, then he and I will go back
and bring the other sleds. Here,&rdquo; he handed
Joe two clips of cartridges, &ldquo;guess they&rsquo;ll not
come back. Never can tell though. You&rsquo;ll be
safe with these.&rdquo; He turned and walked quickly
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Left with his dogs and his outfit, Joe made a
thorough examination of things. Three of his
dogs, Ginger, the leader, Major, the sled guard,
and Bones, his team-mate, were sitting on their
haunches or curled up licking their wounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sport&rsquo;s done in,&rdquo; he murmured with a
queer catch in his throat. &ldquo;Dogs get to be a
fellow&rsquo;s pals up here. Pete&rsquo;s missing. Rushed
out after the retreating enemy to avenge his
team-mate, I guess. Only hope he doesn&rsquo;t get
the worst of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five dead wolves lay near the sled. These
he dragged into a pile. &ldquo;Enough pelts there
for a splendid rug,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get
some Indian woman to tan them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, realizing that it would be some time before
his companions would return, and having
nothing else to do, he began skinning the carcasses.
He had nearly completed the task when,
from the edge of the forest, there came a long-drawn
howl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, again?&rdquo; he exclaimed seizing his
rifle. &ldquo;All right, come on. I&rsquo;m ready for you
this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pair of fiery balls shone out of the shadowy
edge of the forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>Lifting his rifle he took steady aim. His
breath came quick. To shoot in the quiet calm
of perfect self-composure was quite different
from a pitched battle.</p>
<p>He had a perfect bead on the spot between
the eyes, when the creature moved.</p>
<p>He came a few paces closer; then again halted
and howled.</p>
<p>And now once more the boy had a perfect
aim. His finger was on the trigger. It was a
high-power rifle. The shot could not fail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; he whispered to himself. &ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at that instant a strange thing happened.
Old Ginger, the leader, answered the creature&rsquo;s
call. The answer was not hostile but friendly.</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s rifle dropped with a soft plump into the
snow. The next instant he cupped his hands
and shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pete! Pete, you old fool, come on in here.
You nearly got shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was indeed Pete, the huskie. He had returned
safely from his expedition of revenge for
a lost comrade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>As he came trotting in, head up and ears
pricked forward, he marched straight up to Joe,
as a huskie will, and jamming his nose straight
against his leg, gave a big sniff. After that he
curled up with his comrades to lick his wounds.</p>
<p>Two hours later the camp in the forest was
once more in order. The meat had been piled
high upon a hastily made cache of strong
boughs, roped between trees. The dogs had
been bedded down with spruce boughs. All was
snug for the night.</p>
<p>They were preparing to turn in. To-morrow
would be a busy day. They would spend the
greater part of it in camp. The broken sled
must be mended. Joe&rsquo;s dogs must be allowed to
recover from the first shock of the battle. Jennings
would repair the sled. Curlie and Joe
would go ahead breaking the trail on snowshoes
for a few miles. This would be the day&rsquo;s
work; that and keeping a sharp lookout for the
outlaw of the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The outlaw of the air!&rdquo; Curlie was thinking
of him when there came a rattle from the
loud-speaker attached to the receiving set tuned
for long wave lengths.</p>
<p>Leaping to the tuner, he touched its knob,
twisted it first this way, then that. He touched
a second and a third knob, then bent his ear for
the message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another government affair,&rdquo; he told himself.
Then, suddenly, as if bursting out from
the very room, came a loud, &ldquo;Bar-r-r-r!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly his hands flew to the radio-compass
as he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him, the outlaw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He measured the distance accurately, calculated
the direction, then located it on the map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s right there.
Not forty miles. A little off the trail. For
safety from discovery I suppose. Camped
there for the night. By a forced march we
could reach that spot before nightfall to-morrow.
Question is, shall we do it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>Throwing on his coat, he went out of the
tent. There for ten minutes he bathed his
temples, throbbing with excitement, in the cold
night air. Pacing up and down on the narrow
trail he debated the problem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we try to steal upon him, he may discover
us first and elude us,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;If he does that, probably we can&rsquo;t catch him,
for his dogs will be fresher than ours. If we
wait for him here, he may take some Indian trail
which cuts around this point and we may never
see him. So there it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a difficult decision but much quiet
thinking led him to believe that there was more
to be gained by waiting than by moving. They
ought not break trail beyond the point where
they now were. That would but give the man
warning. Early in the morning, he would send
Joe exploring across-trail for any other trail
that might pass close to this one. They would
move camp to a position a few yards off trail
in the forest. Then he would set a watch.</p>
<p>Instinctively, as he entered the tent, he examined
the clip of cartridges in his rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not looking for him to-night, are you?&rdquo;
grinned Joe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, not looking for him, but you never can
tell,&rdquo; said Curlie soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think it&rsquo;s necessary to set a watch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. That dog that guards your sled, old
Major, is watch enough. He&rsquo;ll let us know
if anyone comes down the trail, and even if
they should attempt to escape us they couldn&rsquo;t
do it&mdash;not with two of our teams in prime
condition.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />A WATCH AT THE SIDE OF THE TRAIL</h2>
<p>Early next morning Curlie established himself
in the midst of a thick clump of young pine trees
where he could keep a constant watch on the
trail and not be seen by anyone approaching.</p>
<p>He had dragged into the clump a number of
spruce boughs. On these he sat. On one
side of him was his smaller radiophone receiving
set and on the other his rifle. The receiver
of the radiophone was clamped over his ears
beneath his cap. This day he was to be a
detective of the earth as well as of the air.</p>
<p>The camp had been moved well back from
the trail, where without danger of being heard
Jennings could work upon the broken sled.
Whether their quarry were caught in their trap
this day or not, they must be prepared to
travel on the morrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>As he sat there with his eyes moving up
and down the trail he thought of the adventures
his calling as a secret service man of
the air had brought him. He recalled those
wild hours on the tossing sea when death appeared
so near that it seemed almost to
beckon. He thought of the girl, Gladys Ardmore,
who had behaved so bravely on that night.
He wondered what she might be doing at that
moment.</p>
<p>Then his mind carried him back to the adventure
which appeared to be just before him.
The man he was seeking had repeatedly broken
all the laws of the air. He was subject not
only to heavy fines but also to long years of
imprisonment. That he would fight and willingly
commit murder to escape punishment
Curlie did not doubt. Yet here was Curlie,
ready and willing to attempt to stop him in
his mad career.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One does not do such a thing for himself,&rdquo;
he reasoned. &ldquo;He does it for the good of
others. Here in Alaska are thousands of lonely
people who can be cheered by music, stories and
speeches broadcasted over thousands of miles.
Yet a few outlaws of the air can spoil all that.
It is the duty of some of us to see that they
do not do it. There are matters of even greater
importance; a miner lost on the tundra, snow-blind
and all but hopeless, can, if he has a
small radiophone set, send out a call for aid.
From a large station this message may be
picked up. He may be located and his life
saved. Even the great explorer, Munson, may
need some such assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had he known how prophetic this last thought
was, and how much he was to have to do with
the explorer who was at that moment more than
two thousand miles away on a ship beset by
the perpetual ice of the Arctic, he would have
been startled.</p>
<p>As it was, his mind turned to the mystery
that always surrounds true adventure. He recalled
the words of an old friend:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Adventure, true adventure, like fame, does
not come to those who seek it. It comes unbeckoned
and unannounced. Oh! yes, you can
blunder about and get into all kind of scrapes
which really do not mean anything to yourself
nor to anyone else, but that is not adventure.
You may even succeed in getting yourself killed
without experiencing an adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know an adventure when you see
it. When, with no willing of your own, but
following the plain lead of duty, you feel yourself
going into something as dark and mysterious
as an unexplored cave; when your heart
beats madly, your knees tremble and your tongue
clings to the roof of your mouth, yet you go
straight on because you know that duty leads
you, then you may be sure that you are about
to enter upon a genuine adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Curlie recalled these words he wondered
whether or not, before the day was done, he
would find himself entering upon a true adventure.
Would his quarry, the outlaw of the
air, come down the trail?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>The day wore on. Noon came. He ate a
frozen lunch. The sun sank lower and lower.
His vigil did not relax, but he began to lose
faith in his plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe said he would come and tell me if he
found other trails,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;The
outlaw can&rsquo;t have gone round us. Where can
he be? If we&rsquo;ve missed him&mdash;well, anyway,
he can&rsquo;t escape us. They&rsquo;ll take him when he
enters Valdez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet, as he thought it through, he was not
so sure of it. The man was utterly unknown.
Not one person who was in any way interested
in his capture had ever seen him. Hundreds
of strange men drifted in and out of the seaport
city of Valdez every day. How then was
anyone to put his hand on any one of them and
say, &ldquo;This is the man&rdquo;?</p>
<p>He was interrupted in these disconcerting reflections
by a sound in his receiver. It was a
whisper&mdash;<i>the</i> whisper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello - hello - Curlie,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;Hello - are - you - there?
Do - you - hear - me? I - have - something - important&mdash;dreadfully - important - to
say. He&mdash;the - man - you -
want&mdash;has - turned - back. Went - forty - miles - to-day.
Now he - is camped. So - you - see - you - did - not - get - him - did - you - Curlie?
I - am - sorry - Curlie - extremely - sorry - for - he - goes - fast&mdash;very - very - fast.
You - cannot - catch - him - can - you - Curlie?
So - good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the sound ceased, Curlie leaped to his
feet. His fists were clenched. Through his
tight set teeth he hissed: &ldquo;I can catch him!
I can! I can! And I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastily gathering up his equipment and his
rifle he hurried away at once to break the news
to his companions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>Strange to say, in all this time it had never
occurred to him to doubt the truth of the Whisperer&rsquo;s
message nor to question her sincerity
in wishing him well or in desiring to assist him.
And yet she had been playing a very artful
game of hide-and-go-seek in the air with him
for many weeks and in all that time, except
perhaps that time in the hotel window (told
about in &ldquo;Curlie Carson Listens In&rdquo;), he had
not caught one single glimpse of her. He had
heard her whisper, that was all. Can one
judge a person&rsquo;s character by the quality of his
whisper? Well, that&rsquo;s the question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />WHO IS THIS WHISPERER?</h2>
<p>&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; puzzled Joe, as
Curlie reported the Whisperer&rsquo;s message. &ldquo;Did
he listen in last night when I was calling for
help? And was he frightened by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might have,&rdquo; said Curlie, &ldquo;but anyway
you couldn&rsquo;t help that. You were in a mess
and had to be helped out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the two boys were silent. Then
Curlie spoke again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might not be that at all. I listened in on
a message last night. It was from Munson, the
explorer. It was not broken in upon as his
others have been. There may have been something
in that message which caused the outlaw
to turn back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;whatever
the cause is, we&rsquo;ll go out and after them the first
thing after dawn. Is everything all right;
sled fixed and dogs doctored up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s fine as silk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right then, let&rsquo;s have some chow. After
that we&rsquo;ll turn in. Luck doesn&rsquo;t go with any
one person forever. Why, even to-morrow we
might catch up with our outlaw friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly that,&rdquo; smiled Joe. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
forty or fifty miles of unbroken trail to make
before we really get on the scent at all. By
that time, traveling on a hard-packed trail as
he is, he&rsquo;ll have a big lead on us. There are
probably forks and crosses in the trail a hundred
miles or so farther on, so we&rsquo;ve got a real task
ahead of us. We&rsquo;ll have to be sly as foxes to
catch him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Curlie sighed, &ldquo;but
we&rsquo;ll get him, see if we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe suddenly, &ldquo;who is
this whispering friend of yours anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Curlie, scratching his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever seen her?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s she come to be traveling with this
man anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty queer, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say as much myself. Queer and interesting.
I may as well admit that I am as
much interested in coming up with the Whisperer
as I am in catching this outlaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we won&rsquo;t do either if we don&rsquo;t eat and
turn in,&rdquo; said Joe as he reached for the frying
pan.</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s prophecy that they would not at once
catch up with the man they sought, proved
correct. The first two days they struggled
forward through soft snow, over a trackless
wilderness. Then they came upon the campsite
of the outlaw, his last camping place before
he turned back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>To Curlie this was a thrilling moment. It
was the first earthly sign he had ever seen of
this strange pair, the outlaw and the Whisperer.
Heretofore he had followed only the trackless
trail of the air. Now he had footprints of a
man and of many dogs to go by. The mark
of the camp, though three days old, was as
fresh as if it had been abandoned but two hours
before. There had been no snowfall. There
was never a breath of wind in that forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as his trail is not joined by any
other,&rdquo; Jennings told the boys, &ldquo;we can follow
it with our eyes shut. We could do that three
months from now. There might be four feet
of snowfall, but on top of it all there would
be the depression made in the first two feet of
snow. There is never any wind to move the
snow about, so there&rsquo;s your trail carved in
the snow, permanent as marble till the spring
thaw comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when he comes to the Yukon River
trail?&rdquo; suggested Curlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s going to be harder.&rdquo; The miner
wrinkled his brow. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll find a way to
track him&mdash;the way he hitches his dogs, track
of his sled. There&rsquo;s always something if you
are sharp enough to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>Curlie examined the marks of the camp very
carefully. It was evident that the man knew
as much about making an Arctic camp as did
Jennings. The square made by the tent floor
showed that he had spread down a canvas floor
and the heaps of spruce twigs tossed all about
told that he had bedded the place down before
he spread out his blankets or sleeping-bags.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two teams,&rdquo; was Jennings&rsquo; comment, &ldquo;and
eight or nine dogs to the team. Fine big fellows
too. Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if they were
Siberian wolf hounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One thing Curlie made a secret search for:
footprints. There were enough of one sort.
The broad marks of a man&rsquo;s foot clad in
moccasins or Eskimo skin-boots were everywhere
present. What he sought was the mark
of a smaller foot, a much smaller foot, the foot
of the Whisperer. But though he examined
every square yard of trampled ground around
the camp, and though he ran ahead of the dogs
for two miles after resuming the trail, he saw
no trace of a woman&rsquo;s footprint.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like he drove one dog team and led
the other,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Looks as if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time he began to doubt the
existence of the Whisperer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be,&rdquo; he asked himself, &ldquo;that the
outlaw and the Whisperer are one? Does he
change his voice and pretend to give me tips
when he is in reality only leading me on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his mind he went back over the times
when the Whisperer had broken in on the silence
of the night. There had been those two times
when he had been listening in at the Secret
Tower Room, back there in the city (told about
in &ldquo;Curlie Carson Listens In&rdquo;). There had
been two times when he had caught her whisper
out over the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That time,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;she told me
he had gone north. Why should this man keep
me informed of his own doings? He ought to
know that I&rsquo;d report it; that someone would
follow him if I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;there must be a
real Whisperer. The girl must exist. She&rsquo;s
somewhere up there on the trail ahead of us.
And yet,&rdquo; he reasoned, &ldquo;if she is there, where
are her tracks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he began convincing himself that she
did not exist, that it was all a hoax invented
by the mind of this clever outlaw. The more he
thought of it the more sure he became that this
was true. The more sure he became of it the
more his anger grew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be shamed, to be tricked, deceived,
buncoed by the man you are pursuing!&rdquo; he
exploded. &ldquo;That is adding insult to injury!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the plain trail stretching straight out
before them, they now traveled far into the
night, traveled until dogs and men were ready
to drop. Only then did they turn to the right of
the trail and set their weary muscles to the
task of making camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br />ON THE YUKON</h2>
<p>To follow the trail of the outlaw of the air
for the first four days was but to trace out
his sled-tracks in a wilderness that was trackless
save for the footprints of caribou, wolf and
bear. But once he had reached the Yukon, all
this was changed. There were three trails to
choose from. Which had he taken? The one
to the left which led up the river, the one to
the right, down the river; or the one which
led straight before them up one of the branches
of the mighty Yukon? The last trail, less
traveled than the others, led away toward the
Arctic Ocean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He may have taken the down-river trail,
for that would carry him farther and farther
from communication with the outside world,&rdquo;
said Jennings, as he searched in vain to distinguish
his track from those of scores of other
travelers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might have taken the up-river trail,&rdquo; he
went on. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d be in some danger of getting
caught by a message sent on ahead but since
the telegraph wires are down the message would
have to be sent by radiophone, so he could listen
in and take up some branch and over the hills
if he needed to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d go straight ahead,
up the branch?&rdquo; said Curlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should he?&rdquo; the miner looked at him
in surprise. &ldquo;Up that trail for fifty or a
hundred miles you&rsquo;ll find Indian huts and miners&rsquo;
cabins here and there. After that you&rsquo;ll
find nothing but a blind trail that grows steeper
and steeper. There&rsquo;s no food to be had save
wild game and little enough of that. Why
should he go up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might run up there for a blind and live
with an Indian for a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he did we&rsquo;d trap him like a rabbit in a
hollow stump!&rdquo; declared the miner emphatically.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since we don&rsquo;t know which way to
go and it is getting dark,&rdquo; suggested Joe, &ldquo;I
move that we make camp right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This suggestion was acted upon and some two
hours later Curlie might have been seen nodding
over his radiophone boxes. His companions
were fast asleep but he had remained
up with the receiver clamped over his head in
the rather forlorn hope that the outlaw would
let slip some fragment of message which might
reveal his whereabouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fact is,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;that in spite of
all the evidence against it, I still have a sneaking
feeling that the Whisperer is a real person,
a girl, and that she&rsquo;s up here somewhere in the
white wilderness. I&mdash;I sort of hope that
sooner or later she&rsquo;ll whisper some more secrets
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this hope, for the night at least, he was
doomed to disappointment. No whispered
secrets came to him from out the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>A message came, however, a message which
set his mind at work. He had fallen quite
asleep when he was suddenly wakened by a
voice in his ear. He recognized at once the
voice of the government official who had dictated
that other message regarding the band of
smugglers caught operating on Behring Straits.</p>
<p>The message itself to him was unimportant,
or at least for the time it seemed so. It gave
more definite details of the evidence procured
and stated one fact that was most important:
The big man, the one higher up, the brains of
the smugglers, had not been apprehended. Indeed,
it was not even known who he was. It
was thought that he might be at this moment
in Alaska, but where? This question could not
be answered.</p>
<p>The message had proceeded to this point.
Curlie had maintained a drowsy interest in it,
when he sat up with a sudden start, all awake.</p>
<p>The message had been broken in upon by a
powerful sending set which was much nearer
to Curlie than was that of the government man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got&mdash;gotta get him,&rdquo; he mumbled as his
slim fingers caressed his radio-compass coil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There! Got him! That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was not a moment too soon, for not only
had the message ceased but the interruption as
well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he grunted, scratching his head.
&ldquo;Huh! Up there. Wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it.
Why, good gracious, it can&rsquo;t be! Yet I couldn&rsquo;t
have missed it. How that man travels! Two
hundred miles! And no trail to speak of.
Probably none at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment he sat in a brown study. Then
he suddenly shook his fist toward the north.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get you now, old boy!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get you! You&rsquo;re breaking trail for us.
We&rsquo;ll follow that trail if it takes us right out
on the ice-floes of the Arctic and we&rsquo;ll get you,
just as Jennings says, like a rabbit in a hollow
tree. That is,&rdquo; he said more soberly, &ldquo;if there
doesn&rsquo;t come a heavy snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man, so the radio-compass had said, had
taken the trail which led straight away toward
the Arctic Ocean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>Then for a long time Curlie sat staring at
the knob of his tuner. He did not see the knob.
He did not see anything. He was concentrating,
reasoning, thinking hard, trying to put a lot of
facts together and make them fit.</p>
<p>So the master-mind of the smugglers had
not been caught. What if the outlaw of the
air proved to be that man. Why might he not?
That would explain why he was so continually
breaking in upon the message regarding it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; he whispered, leaping to his feet
and dashing out of the tent in his excitement,
&ldquo;that would explain why he appears so eager
to frustrate all of Munson&rsquo;s plans to keep in
touch with the outside world by radiophone.
Munson assisted in breaking up the smuggler
band. If the outlaw is their leader, there is
nothing he would not do to wreak revenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and&rdquo;&mdash;he breathed hard because of
the thoughts that came trooping into his mind mind&mdash;&ldquo;that
might explain the man&rsquo;s change of plans.
The very night that Munson sent his message
telling of his supply of food on the shore of
the ocean this outlaw, who probably listened in,
turned about and started straight north, to&mdash;to
where?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>Dashing back into the tent, he unfolded a
map. For a moment with strained attention he
studied it.</p>
<p>When he straightened up it was to whisper,
&ldquo;Yes, sir! That&rsquo;s it! Flaxman Island! His
present course will bring him straight to Flaxman
Island and Munson&rsquo;s food supply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down again. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he asked himself,
&ldquo;once he arrives there, what will he do?
Will he winter there, living upon the explorer&rsquo;s
supplies and thus save himself from prison, or
will he, out of revenge, destroy the supplies?
If he stays and lives on the supplies, what will
happen if Munson comes ashore with his band?
Huh, some interesting problems there!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting and foolish,&rdquo; he told himself
as he dropped into another mood. &ldquo;All imagination,
I guess. Suppose there&rsquo;s nothing to it.
Probably he&rsquo;s not the king of smugglers at all,
but just a plain mischief-maker of the air.
When he caught Joe&rsquo;s message to me, that night
when we fought the wolves, he knew he was
being pursued and turned back. Now he&rsquo;s
hiding out till the storm blows over. Possibly
knows where there is a native reindeer herder
up there at the end of the stream and over the
hills!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, old top,&rdquo; he again shook his fist toward
the north, &ldquo;you might just as well come
out of your hole. The storm isn&rsquo;t going to blow
over. Your little cabin of false dreams is going
to be wrecked by it, and that before many
days.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />A MOVING SPOT ON THE HORIZON</h2>
<p>But the outlaw&rsquo;s teams of powerful dogs had
endurance to exceed anything ever before witnessed
by those who followed on their trail.
Even Jennings was astonished by the manner
in which they ate up the miles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those dogs are devils!&rdquo; he exclaimed after
ten days of trailing them. &ldquo;Devils is what they
are and the prince of devils is their driver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Straight north the trail ran. There could
be no mistaking it. In the soft snow of the
forest, as Jennings had said, it might have been
followed after three months had elapsed just
as surely as on the day after it was made.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>Up frozen streams, over ridges when streams
were too rapid to freeze even in midwinter,
down narrow Indian trails when snow-laden
branches constantly showered the traveler with
snow, the trail led. On and on and on. Always,
as nearly as possible, due north.</p>
<p>At night, camp made and supper over, Curlie,
his instruments before him, his receiver over
his head, always sat on his sleeping-bag. With
arms crossed over his feet, with head dropping
forward, like Jack London&rsquo;s primitive man, he
listened for sounds. The sounds he expected to
hear were from the air, not from the forest;
that was the only difference. Otherwise he was
that same primitive man, hunting and being
hunted in turn. He was ever pursuing the outlaw,
but who could tell when this same outlaw
might face about upon the trail and become
himself the hunter?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>So they moved forward. Once Curlie received
a thrill. On examining a camp lately
deserted by the one who went before, he came
upon a strange footprint, a single print of
moccasin or skin-boot in the snow. Yet how
it made his heart beat! This footprint was
much smaller than that of the outlaw. Could
this be the Whisperer? At first it seemed to
him that there could be but one answer: &ldquo;It
is.&rdquo; But at that time they were not beyond
the creeks and rivers inhabited and traveled by
Indians. Two Indian sleds had not long since
passed that way. Might it not be that some
Indian woman or girl had visited the camp of
the outlaw? So Curlie&rsquo;s certainty was destroyed,
yet he still had a feeling that this might have
been the footprint of the Whisperer.</p>
<p>Nothing more came to him from the air.
The outlaw was silent. So too was the Whisperer.
Night after night he caught only now
and again a fragment of some song or some
orchestra production being broadcasted thousands
of miles away. Now and again there
would come fragments of messages from afar,
but never anything of importance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>From the air they learned nothing of the
position of the outlaw, but by examining the
signs of camp and trail Jennings, long accustomed
to these signs, was able to announce to
them each night that they were drawing closer,
ever nearer to the man they sought. Now they
were three days&rsquo; journey from him; now two,
now one and a half, now only one. Faint and
far distant they fancied they caught sight of the
column of smoke rising straight above the forest
from his camp fire.</p>
<p>Food became scarce. They had bought dried
fish from the last Indian camp they had come
upon. Now this had to suffice for both men and
dogs. The outlaw, they knew by signs of the
trail, had been more fortunate. Once, a reindeer
straying from some distant domestic herd
had forfeited life by crossing his path; at
another time a caribou doe and her fawn had
fallen victim to his rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough luck,&rdquo; Jennings had exclaimed.
&ldquo;Him with all that fresh meat and us with
none; but the tables will turn. We&rsquo;re gaining,
gaining every day. The soft trail for him becomes
hard for us, after the night&rsquo;s freeze.
You&rsquo;ll see, we&rsquo;ll get him yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where do you think he&rsquo;s heading for?&rdquo;
Joe demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; Jennings scratched his head.
&ldquo;Maybe some Eskimo village, maybe some reindeer
camp and maybe&mdash;did you say Munson
had a supply camp somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe he&rsquo;s heading for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To use it or destroy it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Destroy it?&rdquo; Jennings stared at him in
astonishment. &ldquo;What would be the sense of
destroying it? He doesn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;s being followed;
leastwise, I don&rsquo;t think he does. Who&rsquo;d
think of destroying a winter&rsquo;s supply of grub?
It wasn&rsquo;t Napoleon who burned Moscow, was
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe did not answer, but he and Curlie had
their own private notions about the matter.</p>
<p>Then, just as they hoped to be closing in upon
the prey, two things happened which postponed
that great event for many days. They came
suddenly out upon the open tundra, where the
snow was hard-packed by the wind, where the
trail was difficult to follow, and where, with as
good a trail as the boys had to follow, the soft
snow no longer gave them the advantage and
the outlaw could make as good time as they&mdash;probably
better, for his dogs were stronger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bad luck to us,&rdquo; Jennings stormed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
have to follow him straight to the Arctic and us
with no food but a dozen pounds of fish. If we
don&rsquo;t watch out we&rsquo;ll be in full retreat, eating
our dogs as we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie, who had been sitting on his sled
silently watching something in the distance, suddenly
leaped to his feet exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It moves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does?&rdquo; demanded Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something off there to the left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think it&rsquo;s him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The outlaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. What I do think though is that
it&rsquo;s a reindeer or caribou.&rdquo; A moment later he
ordered: &ldquo;Make camp right here. We&rsquo;ve got
to have meat and this is our chance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>Looking to the clip in his rifle, he turned to
go, then, after a second&rsquo;s reflection he turned
back, partly unpacked the sled and, having
dragged out a strange-looking belt, buckled it
on beneath his mackinaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just by way of extra precaution,&rdquo; he smiled.</p>
<p>Atop the nearest ridge he turned to wave his
hand. Had he known what events would transpire
before he saw his companions again he
would most surely have turned back. Not knowing,
he shaded his eyes for a moment once more
to locate the moving spot on the horizon, then
went strolling down the low hill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br />A BAD FOLLOW UP</h2>
<p>Having covered half the distance between
himself and the brown spot on the horizon,
Curlie decided to drop down below the crest of
the hill. By going up a narrow ravine for a
half mile, then creeping over the ridge and following
down the bend of a second ravine, he
would, he was sure, come out close to the feeding
animal, quite close enough for a shot.</p>
<p>Stealthily he carried out his plans. When at
last he reached the end of this little journey and,
with finger on the trigger, slowly rose from the
ground where he had been creeping for the last
hundred yards, he was so surprised that for a
second he felt paralyzed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>There, not twenty yards away, with his back
to the boy, feeding like some contented domesticated
creature in a pasture, stood as fine a buck
caribou as one might ask to see. The wind being
away from him, and toward the boy, he had
neither smelled, heard nor seen Curlie. He did
not even know of the boy&rsquo;s presence there.</p>
<p>To say that Curlie was suddenly stricken with
buck fever, would be putting it mildly. His
fingers trembled. Cold perspiration stood out
upon his brow.</p>
<p>This lasted but a second, then he was himself
again. It was a tense moment. The fate of
their expedition might hang upon his shot; the
question of going on or turning about must be
decided by their ability to procure food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;how in time do you
shoot a caribou when he&rsquo;s got his back to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated. A shot fired now might not
reach a vital spot, yet the creature might at any
moment sense his presence and go crashing
away over the hard-crusted snow.</p>
<p>At this moment he was startled by a loud
&ldquo;ark-ark-ark&rdquo; to the right and above him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he whispered as he dropped
behind his snow bank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>The thing he now witnessed both surprised
and amused him. A second caribou had appeared
at the crest of a steep hill. Having
paused there long enough to call to his companion,
instead of racing away to a place of
gradual descent, he spread out his snowshoe-like
hoofs and with a loud &ldquo;ark-ark,&rdquo; went scooting,
toboggan-fashion, down the hill. So fascinated
was Curlie with the sight of this performance
that for a moment he forgot his duty to his
friends and himself. But just in time he
brought himself up with a snap. The rifle went
to his shoulder. Just as the second buck, the
larger of the two, reached the bottom and stood
at attention, the rifle cracked. The buck leaped
high, to plunge back upon the snow.</p>
<p>Crack-crack-crack went the hoofs of the first
caribou as he raced away, and the crack-crack-crack
answered the rifle.</p>
<p>It took not a second glance to tell Curlie that
his first shot had reached its mark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Think I hit the other. Two&rsquo;s better than
one,&rdquo; he muttered as he raced away over the
fresh trail. True enough, there were drops of
blood here and there on the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went over the ridge. I&rsquo;ll get him!&rdquo; Curlie
snapped a fresh cartridge into his magazine as
he went zig-zagging his way up the hard-packed
and slippery hill. Twice he lost his footing and
narrowly escaped a slide to the bottom, but each
time he escaped by digging into the snow with
fingers and toes.</p>
<p>At the top he breathed a sigh of relief. For
a few seconds he could catch no sight of the
caribou, then he saw it disappearing over the
next ridge. Just as it dropped from sight, it
appeared to stumble and fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done for!&rdquo; exulted the boy. &ldquo;Just one
more ridge and I&rsquo;ve got him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a second he hesitated. It was growing
dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought to go back,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;But
there&rsquo;ll be a moon in an hour and I can get along
without light till then.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>Hurriedly sliding down the ridge, he made his
way up the other. Arrived there, he glanced
straight ahead, expecting to see the caribou lying
at the bottom of the ravine. But not a brown
speck marred the whiteness of that snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I was sure
he was done for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By looking closely, he was able to see four
sharply-cut paths in the snow crust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He tobogganed down and I thought he fell,&rdquo;
Curlie grinned. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one on me. Well,
there&rsquo;s no use to follow him. If he is well
enough to go tobogganing, he&rsquo;s not greatly in
need of attention. I better get back and tend
to the other one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darkness had fallen. It was with the greatest
difficulty that he made his way back to the spot
where the dead caribou lay.</p>
<p>Once there he proceeded to cut up the meat.
Then, having built a cache out of blocks of snow
which would keep the meat out of reach of
wolves and foxes, he shouldered one hind quarter
and turned to go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>Then and not till then did he realize that he
did not exactly know the way back to camp. He
had come a considerable distance, and in the
eager excitement of the hunt had failed to take
note of each turn in his trail or to fix in his
memory the shapes of the hills about him that
they might serve him as guide posts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty pickle!&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Here I&rsquo;ve
got a heavy load and I&rsquo;ll likely as not have to
walk ten miles to make five. Going to storm,
too,&rdquo; he told himself as he studied the hazy
horizon. &ldquo;The mountains were smoking with
snow forty miles away this afternoon. Ho, well,
guess I&rsquo;ll make it some way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shouldering his burden, he went slipping,
sliding down the hill. He had not been going
many minutes before he realized that he was
not going to &ldquo;make it someway&rdquo;&mdash;not that
night at least.</p>
<p>A playful breeze began throwing fine snow in
his face. As he approached the crest of a ridge
this breeze grew rude. It gave him a shove
which landed him halfway back down the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that, you!&rdquo; he grumbled as he gathered
himself up and attempted the hill anew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>But the thing did not stop. It grew in violence
until the boy knew he was facing one of
the sudden, severe blizzards known only on the
Arctic hills, a storm which no man can face for
hours and live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d just
blunder round till I&rsquo;m hot and exhausted, then
sit down and freeze. Better sit down here while
I&rsquo;m still all here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Making his way to a spot somewhat sheltered
by a cut bank, he placed his burden on the
ground, then set to work with his sheath knife
cutting blocks from a snow bank. Out of these
he built a snow-fort-like affair which protected
him on two sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I knew how to build a snow-house,&rdquo;
he told himself. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t, so what&rsquo;s the use
to try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having accomplished this much, he cut thin
strips of meat from the caribou carcass. These
he placed upon the snow. When they had frozen
he ate them with relish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;M-m!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Most as good as
cooked and a whole lot better than dried fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having eaten, he gathered his garments close
in about him and sat down upon the ground.</p>
<p>Presently he rose suddenly and, having drawn
several small articles from pockets in his belt,
proceeded to wind a coil antenna. This when
completed he hung to the top of his Alpine staff
which he had stuck upright in the snow. Then,
having thrust a pair of receivers over his head,
he sat down again.</p>
<p>In the belt there was arranged a complete
radiophone receiving set with a range of two
hundred miles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might hear something more interesting than
the storm,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;B&rsquo;r&rsquo;r&rsquo;r! It&rsquo;s sure
going to be bad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />SAVED BY A WHISPER</h2>
<p>Back in the camp Jennings was working on
an Eskimo type of harness for Ginger, Joe
Marion&rsquo;s leader. The white man&rsquo;s collar, which
was very much like a leather horse collar, had
worn a sore spot on his neck. A harness made
of strips of sealskin and fashioned in a manner
somewhat similar to a breast collar, would relieve
this.</p>
<p>Joe Marion had gone a short way from camp
in the hope of finding a snowshoe rabbit or a
ptarmigan. His search had been rewarded. In
crossing a low hill he had caught the whir of
wings and had, a moment later, sighted three
snow-white ptarmigan. These quails of the
Arctic wilderness went racing away across the
snow. His aim was good and, with all three of
these in his bag, he was sure of some delicious
broth and tender, juicy meat that night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>He was searching about for other birds when
a sudden gust of wind sent cutting bits of snow
into his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he grunted, looking away to his left.
&ldquo;Well, now, that looks like business. Came up
quick, too. I&rsquo;d better be getting back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had no trouble finding his way back to
camp, but by the time he reached it the snow
fog was so thick he could not see three rods
before him.</p>
<p>He found Jennings struggling with the tent
ropes. The tent was in a complete state of
collapse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wind tore it down,&rdquo; shouted Jennings.
&ldquo;Give&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind caught the tent and fairly tore it
from his grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us a hand,&rdquo; he puffed as he regained
his hold. &ldquo;This is going to be bad. Got to
pack up and get out of here and find shelter of
some kind. Tent won&rsquo;t stand here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of willow bushes with the dead
leaves on down there by a little stream,&rdquo; suggested
Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the place. We can tie the ropes to
the willows. Willows keep off the wind. Come
on, let&rsquo;s pack up.&rdquo; Jennings threw the tent into
a heap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Curlie? He&rsquo;ll be coming back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set up a stake. Write a note. Tell where
we&rsquo;ve gone. Got a pencil, paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You write it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Creeping beneath the overthrown tent, Joe
managed to scribble a note. This he fastened
securely to an Alpine staff and, having tied a
red handkerchief to the staff that Curlie might
not miss it, set it solidly in a hard-packed snowbank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said Jennings. &ldquo;Now give us
a hand. Watch your face; it&rsquo;s freezin&rsquo;&mdash;your
cheeks. Take your mitten off and rub &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>The dogs, with tails to the wind, stood patiently
enduring the storm. But when Jennings
tried to get his team together they backed,
twisted and turned in such a manner as to render
them useless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Ginger,&rdquo; shouted Joe, &ldquo;here Bones,
Pete, Major. Show &rsquo;em what a real dog team
can do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So great was the comradeship between these
dogs and their young master that he was able
in a moment&rsquo;s time to hitch them to the sled,
ready for action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old boys!&rdquo; he muttered hoarsely;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve fought wolves together. Now we&rsquo;ll fight
this blizzard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sled-load of camp equipment was soon moving
down to the willows by the creek bed.</p>
<p>In the course of an hour they had succeeded
in establishing a safe and fairly comfortable
camp. The dry willow leaves served in lieu of
Arctic feathers, while the stems and branches
made a crackling fire whose genial warmth pervaded
the tent in spite of the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for a feed,&rdquo; said Joe, producing his
hunting bag.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What you got?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ptarmigan. Three of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll save one for Curlie,&rdquo; said Joe, tossing
one of the birds into the corner. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be better
piping hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried about Curlie,&rdquo; said Jennings,
cocking his head on one side to listen to the
howl of the storm. &ldquo;This is no night to be out
alone. Ought to do something, only we can&rsquo;t;
not a thing. Be lost yourself in no time if you
went out to look for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fix these birds and I&rsquo;ll set up the radio-phone,&rdquo;
suggested Joe. &ldquo;He took his belt set
with him. We can at least listen in for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later, as he sipped a cup of delicious
broth, Joe gave an exclamation of disgust:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of all my listening in? He
can&rsquo;t get a message off. He&rsquo;d have to have a
high aerial for that. Could manage it with balloons
on a still night, but not in this gale. Wires
would tangle in an instant. You can&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>He broke off abruptly, to clasp his receivers to
his ears. He was getting something.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Curlie had once read a book written by a man
whose daring exploits in the north he had
greatly admired. This writer had said that the
notion that falling asleep when out in a blizzard
might cause one&rsquo;s death by freezing was a great
mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should you find yourself lost in a blizzard,&rdquo;
he remembered the words as well as he might
had he read them but an hour before, &ldquo;seek
out a sheltered spot and compose yourself as
best you can. Save your strength. If you can
fall asleep, so much the better. You will awake
refreshed. You will not freeze. If you become
chilled, the cold will waken you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if that is true?&rdquo; he thought to
himself as he huddled against the cut bank between
his two walls of snow to watch the snow
sifting down the hillside like sand down a dune.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>He did not attempt to decide whether or not
he would put the thing to a test. He merely sat
there until the white, sifting snow became brown
and gold, until the gale became a gentle breeze,
until all about him was the warmth of a tropical
clime.</p>
<p>Before him a palm tree spread its inviting
shade. Across the horizon a slow procession
moved, camels and horses. &ldquo;A caravan,&rdquo; he
murmured. Then silently the scene shifted.
Before him instead of palms were cacti. Instead
of camels a great herd of cattle urged on by men
on horseback, who swung sombreros and lariats.
A cloud of dust followed the herd lazily. But
ever just before him the brown sand sifted,
sifted, sifted eternally.</p>
<p>Into this scene there moved a beautiful girl.
She was dressed in the gay costume of a
Mexican; her cheeks were brown with the sun,
but she was good to look at. Moving with a
strange grace, she came close to him and whispered
in his ear. What she said was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curlie! Curlie Carson, are you there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>The question seemed so strange that he
started, and, starting, he suddenly awoke. The
girl and her desert vanished like magic. Before
him the sifting still went on, but now again it
was sifting snow. Drowsy with fatigue, benumbed
but not chilled by the cold, he had
fallen asleep and had been dreaming. The two
deserts were but dreams.</p>
<p>As he sat there staring at the snow he suddenly
realized that part of his dream was reality;
the whisper continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curlie Carson, can you hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clapping his hands to his ears, he suddenly
realized that his belt radio was working and
that the Whisperer had returned.</p>
<p>Springing to his feet, he attempted to grasp
the coil aerial. His hands and arms were like
blocks of wood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>Madly he thrashed them about until circulation
was partially restored. The Whisperer was
still speaking. What she said was not as important
as the mere fact that she was speaking
at all. He had remembered that he was lost.
He thought he knew about where she and the
outlaw should be located. If he could but discover
the direction from which this whisper
came, he might take a course to the left of it
and in that way find the camp of his companions.
It was a desperate chance but better than none.
He was now convinced that the writer of that
book was mistaken. He knew now that a person
with a clear conscience has no business going
to sleep when the mercury is thirty or forty
below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you - there - Curlie?&rdquo; came the whisper.
&ldquo;I would - have - called - you - sooner Curlie -
but I - could not. We - have come - a - long
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, now his fingers were working. He could
move the coil. He held his breath. Had the
last word been spoken? Was he lost as before?
No!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something - tells - me - you - are - near -
us - now - Curlie. Do - be - careful. It - is -
dangerous - very - very dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>As the whispered words ceased, Curlie&rsquo;s
fingers trembled. He had located the Whisperer
not forty miles away. He thought he knew the
way back to camp. The wind had fallen somewhat.
There was now a chance, a chance for
his life. Dragging out his pocket compass, he
fought his way to the top of the hill, then
mapped out as best he could a course which
should take him to camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />A STRANGE SIGHT</h2>
<p>Before leaving his shelter Curlie hacked from
the quarter of caribou meat a piece the size
of a roast. This he managed to tie to his back.
He then faced up the hill and, having reached
the top, scrambled and slid to the valley beyond.</p>
<p>A wild battle with the storm followed. Panting,
freezing, aching in every muscle, yet doggedly
determined, he fought his way from hilltop
to hilltop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought to be getting near the place,&rdquo; he
told himself as he found himself in a valley
broader than any other he had crossed. &ldquo;Nothing
looks familiar. Can&rsquo;t see far. Blamed
snow keeps blowing so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>Suddenly he stopped short. A black hulk
loomed just before him. His heart skipped a
beat? What was it? A cabin? Some Indian&rsquo;s
hut? A miner&rsquo;s shack? What a boon in a wild
night such as this!</p>
<p>He was not left long in doubt. Pressing
eagerly forward for twenty yards he at last
paused to exclaim: &ldquo;Willows! Just willows
with dead leaves on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But willows were something. They meant a
shelter from the blasts of wind which had been
slowly beating the life out of him. They meant,
too, a possible fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just get into them and see what can
be done,&rdquo; he mumbled as he once more beat his
way forward.</p>
<p>So great was the relief from getting away
from the knife-edged wind that he felt there
must be somewhere among the willows a hidden
fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might make one, at that,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>Struggling through the dense growth, he
came at last to an open spot some five yards
in diameter which, he decided, was probably a
frozen pool. About this the willows grew to
a height of eight feet. The protection from
the gale was complete.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll camp here till it blows over!&rdquo; he thought
as he began cutting down some slender willows
with his sheath knife. These he spread on the
smooth surface of the bare spot. Above them
he built a tent-shaped shelter with only one end
open. This completed, he began making a pile
of dry twigs and leaves. Over this at last he
piled larger, green branches. Finally he dug
down in the soft snow to where deep beds of
mosses lay. These were soft and dry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good tinder,&rdquo; he murmured as he unwrapped
a package of matches and struck one
of them.</p>
<p>Soon he had a crackling fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;Much better!
Might even do a little cooking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chipping off strips of frozen meat, he sharpened
a twig and strung them upon it. These he
held before the fire until they were done to a
delicious brown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mm!&rdquo; he exulted. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be better!
I only wish the other boys had some. Wonder
just where they are now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had he but known it, they were camped in
the other end of this willow clump, not a quarter
of a mile away. Five minutes&rsquo; walk down the
frozen stream would have brought him to them.
But they had allowed their fire to die down and
had crept into their sleeping-bags. No smoke
came from them to him and the smoke from his
fire was blown directly away from them; so they
passed the night in ignorance of their close
proximity to each other. When morning came
they took courses which carried them miles
apart.</p>
<p>As for Curlie, when morning broke and he
found the storm had passed, he at once made his
way to the top of the hill to reconnoiter. There
strange things awaited him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>As he reached the crest of the hill he beheld,
apparently on the ridge just beyond, a sight
which caused his pulse to quicken. He saw
two dog teams moving along at a steady walk.
There were seven dogs in the first team and
eight in the second. They were hitched white
man fashion, two and two abreast. The sleds
of the long, basket type were well loaded. Atop
the first rode a powerfully built man, dressed
in an Eskimo parka. On the second sled, with
back to Curlie, rode another person. Dressed as
this one was in an Eskimo costume, one might
have said he was looking at a small Eskimo
man, a woman or a girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The outlaw and the Whisperer,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>Involuntarily his feet moved forward. To
approach them alone would seem madness. Yet,
so great was his desire to unravel their secret
that beyond question he would have risked it.
But a strange thing happened at that moment.</p>
<p>The sled party had come to the end of the
ridge. They should naturally have gone gliding
down the slope but, to Curlie&rsquo;s vast astonishment,
they moved straight on into thin air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rdquo;&mdash;his mouth flew open in astonishment.</p>
<p>The next instant he laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A mirage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was. As he focused his eyes closely
upon the scene he could detect the faint outline
of the long ridge upon which the party was
really traveling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be forty miles away,&rdquo; he told himself,
&ldquo;and I was going to stop them. Well,
anyway,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a glimpse that may
aid us in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He set himself to studying every detail of
the equipment&mdash;dogs, harnesses, sleds, clothing,
everything. He even sat down on the snow
and traced on an old envelope with the stub
of a pencil the picture as he saw it.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, the sleds dropped from
view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light changed or they came to the edge of
the ridge,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>Left to his own thoughts, he began to doubt
that this was the outlaw and his companion.
There were natives in this region. These people
had been dressed as natives. True, the dogs
were hitched white man fashion and the sleds
were white man type, but the Eskimo had
learned many things from the whites; they took
pleasure in imitating this superior race of people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;it might not have
been them. I don&rsquo;t really know that the Whisperer
exists at all. I don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused suddenly, to stare away to the
left of him where was another stream and a
second long clump of willows. The wind had
dropped to a whisper. The air was keen and
clear. From the midst of this clump of willows,
straight up a hundred feet there rose a thin,
pencil-like column of white vapor which appeared
to be smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now who,&rdquo; he asked himself, &ldquo;can be
camping down there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His heart beat fast. Was it Jennings and
Joe? He would see.</p>
<p>Hurriedly, yet with utmost caution, he made
his way down the hill toward that clump of
willows from which the thin column continued
to rise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br />CURLIE VANISHES</h2>
<p>As soon as morning broke, Joe and Jennings
were out of the tent and away to make a search
for their lost comrade.</p>
<p>With Joe&rsquo;s team of four dogs and an empty
sled they struck away up the hill in the direction
of their old camp. They found the tattered
handkerchief still fluttering in the breeze and
Joe&rsquo;s note safe beside it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not been here,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;Better drive
out there in the direction he took when he went
after that caribou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking his team to the right of the old camp
site he led them backward and forward until
Ginger, the leader, suddenly pricked up his ears
and whined.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got the scent,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s on
the trail. He&rsquo;s a hound. Hounds are great for
that. All we got to do is to follow. Ginger will
find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away they raced after the dogs. Ginger did
not hesitate for a moment until he led them
straight to the pile of snow on which Curlie
had cached his caribou meat, the part he could
not carry away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shows he got his game,&rdquo; said Joe, looking
with a feeling of pure joy at the pile of fresh
meat.</p>
<p>As for the dogs, they stood on their haunches
and howled with delight. Hacking off some
small pieces Jennings threw one to each dog.
These they swallowed at a gulp. He next piled
the meat on the sled and lashed it there securely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well take it along,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>Once more Joe took the dogs in a circle that
they might pick up the trail. They found it
at once and went racing away. But at the
crest of the second hill they paused and refused
to go farther.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>Urge them as he might, lead them back and
forth as he did, Joe could not get them to pick
up the trail and go on.</p>
<p>The truth was that the trail did not go on.
They had come to the spot where, after following
the second caribou, Curlie had turned
back. All tracks were snow blown but the
scent was still there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost the trail,&rdquo; said Jennings after a half
hour of fruitless endeavor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess so,&rdquo; said Joe, wrinkling his brow.
&ldquo;Guess the only thing we can do is to look
around over the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did &ldquo;look around over the hills.&rdquo; They
searched until darkness began to fall, but discovered
no trace of their missing comrade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well go back to camp,&rdquo; suggested
Jennings. &ldquo;He may have found his way back.
He&mdash;he&rsquo;s sure to turn up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a tone in his voice which suggested
that Curlie might not turn up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>Hungry and weary, they were making their
way back to camp when, on reaching the end of
the willow clump farthest from camp old Ginger
suddenly pricked up his ears and springing
into the bushes attempted to drag his teammates
after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey there, you Ginger!&rdquo; shouted Joe.
&ldquo;What you doin&rsquo; there. Got a rabbit er something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be a trail,&rdquo; said Jennings excitedly.
&ldquo;Cut him out of the team; hang on to his
trace, follow him and see where he takes you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Joe&rsquo;s great astonishment the dog led him
straight to a willow bush camp and the ashes
of a burned-out fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A camp!&rdquo; he exclaimed. Then he shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jennings! Tie up the other dogs and
come in here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it could have been Curlie
that made this camp?&rdquo; he asked after the miner
had looked it over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might have. There&rsquo;s nothing to prove he
did or didn&rsquo;t. Snow&rsquo;s too hard to leave footprints
and there&rsquo;s no other sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems queer, doesn&rsquo;t it? Not a hundred
rods from our camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Question is,&rdquo; said Jennings, &ldquo;whoever he
may be, where has he gone? If he&rsquo;s a stranger
he may have looted our tent by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Joe, greatly disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out on the edge of the bushes and
see if Ginger doesn&rsquo;t pick up his trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old leader did pick up a trail at once.
The trail led away from their camp. They were
tired and hungry, but for all that, so eager were
they to find some trace of Curlie and to solve
this new mystery that they cached the meat in
the tops of some stout willows and supperless
turned their faces to the trail.</p>
<p>It was growing dark but since there was nothing
to be done save to follow the dog leader,
they marched on over hill and valley in silence.</p>
<p>At last they found they were approaching a
second clump of willows. Involuntarily Joe
reached for his rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be camped there,&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;May be all right; may not. In a wilderness
like this you never can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>They approached the clump of bushes in
silence. It was a small clump, soon searched.
It was empty. They were about to leave it in
disgust when Joe suddenly exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here at this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed at some bushes from which the
leaves had been completely stripped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reindeer or caribou,&rdquo; whispered the miner
as if afraid of being overheard. Snapping on
his flashlight, Joe examined the bushes and the
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe you&rsquo;re right. There are his tracks.
He&rsquo;s trampled the ground in a circle and eaten
all the leaves in a circle too. How do you account
for that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reindeer tied to the bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reindeer of the man we have been following,&rdquo;
said Joe thoughtfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>The conclusion was so obvious that neither
of them troubled to voice it. Curlie Carson had
no reindeer, therefore it was evident that it
had not been he whom they had been following
on this new scent. Some man, who it was they
could not even guess, had come to their willow
clump and had camped there all night. Before
coming he had tied his reindeer to this other
clump and had left him there. In the morning
he had returned to the reindeer and, having
untied him, had driven away. At least this was
the way Joe reasoned it out in his own mind.
It was probable that Jennings&rsquo; conclusion was
not far from the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is probable,&rdquo; Joe went on to assure himself,
&ldquo;that this fellow is some Eskimo herder,
who having left his reindeer to search for other
reindeer or for rabbit and ptarmigan, has been
caught in the storm and been obliged to camp
in our willow clump for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this fine reasoning was, as reasoning very
often is, entirely wrong. But since neither Joe
nor Jennings knew it to be wrong, they turned
their reluctant dogs toward camp and wearily
made their way back.</p>
<p>Joe was thoroughly downhearted. Curlie, he
felt sure, had been frozen to death. There was
nothing left but to go on without him, but without
his genius to aid them it seemed probable
that the expedition would end in utter failure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>The message he had caught the night before
had been that of the Whisperer; the one which
had so fortunately wakened Curlie from what
might have been a fatal sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Whisperer was less than forty
miles away,&rdquo; Joe now told himself. &ldquo;If Curlie
had got back to camp we might by now have
had our man in handcuffs. As it is, he has
made another day&rsquo;s travel and the race is still
young. But,&rdquo; he thought, with a feeling of determination,
&ldquo;with Curlie, we&rsquo;d catch him yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br />A STRANGE STEED</h2>
<p>As you have doubtless guessed, the camp discovered
by Joe and Jennings was that made by
Curlie. They had been on his trail and not
on the trail of some stranger. But had they
attempted to follow his trail from that last
clump of willows where the reindeer had been
tied they would have become more and more
bewildered, and had they followed that trail all
night they would have caught no glimpse of
their lost companion.</p>
<p>That you may understand why all this is true,
I must tell you what happened to Curlie after
he began to approach the clump of willows from
which rose the thin column of white vapor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad I&rsquo;ve got my rifle,&rdquo; he told himself, as
he moved in close to the willows. &ldquo;You can
never tell what you&rsquo;re coming up against.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>Walking on tiptoes, he approached the end of
the willow clump farthest from the column of
white vapor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just slip in through here and have the first
look,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>Pushing aside the bushes, he disappeared behind
the dead leaves. There was not a breath
of wind. This made it hard. It was impossible
to avoid rustling the leaves. Since there
was no wind to stir up other leaves, he felt sure
that his presence must be detected.</p>
<p>His breath came quick as he paused to listen.
No sound came to him. He moved on a few
paces, then suddenly he paused. Had he caught
a sound? Yes, there it was, a rustling of the
leaves, of branches switching together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; he whispered, crouching
low. &ldquo;May be a signal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time he did not move. When at
length he ventured to go forward, it was on
hands and knees. Down low there were no
leaves. Traveling in this manner he made no
sound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>Only once his foot touched his rifle, causing a
rattling sound.</p>
<p>Stopping dead still, he paused with wildly
beating heart to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fool I am,&rdquo; he told himself at last,
&ldquo;creeping up on some simple innocent people
probably. But when a fellow is a hunter, he
gets the habit of wanting to have the first look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later he did get the &ldquo;first look.&rdquo;
And at that instant he leaped to his feet and let
out a wild shout of laughter.</p>
<p>The only creature to be seen in the bushes
was a milk-white reindeer. This deer was
hitched to a short, flat sled, such as reindeer
herders use. The sled was overturned and had
tangled with the willows. Because of this and
because of the three inch wide rawhide strap
which held him to the sled, the reindeer was
unable to move from the spot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>The explanation of the column of vapor was
not far to seek. It was merely the deer&rsquo;s breath
rising straight up from the willows. Since it
was intensely cold the moisture from his breath
froze at once and since there was not a breath of
air stirring it could be seen mounting in air for
many feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t do to get too close to an enemy
on such a day,&rdquo; he told himself; &ldquo;he&rsquo;d spot you
in an instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This knowledge was destined to prove of
great value to him in the days that were to
come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; he said, addressing the deer,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you. Question is, what am I going to
do with you. You&rsquo;re evidently a bad actor; must
have run away from your master. And I
never drove a reindeer in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused in thought. The reindeer would
be of service to him if he could but learn to
drive him. He needed no food save that which
the tundra supplied, the reindeer moss under
the snow. To ride on the broad-bottomed sled
in his search for his companions would be far
preferable to walking; besides, it meant more
speed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he grunted, &ldquo;try anything once.
So, you old lost ship on the Arctic desert, let&rsquo;s
turn you over and see what you&rsquo;ve got on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grasping the sled he disentangled it enough to
allow him to turn it over. The sled carried a
light load, all of which was covered with a
piece of canvas securely bound on by a rawhide
rope. That the reindeer had traveled some distance
was testified to by the fact that many holes
had been torn in the canvas as the sled traveled
upside-down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what treasure is hidden here,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>His fingers trembled from curiosity as he
untied the rope.</p>
<p>To his joy he found a very good sleeping-bag
of deerskin, a pair of deerskin mittens, three
large frozen fish and a camp-kit consisting of
knives, spoons, cups, a tinplate, matches, reindeer
sinew for thread and various other odds
and ends beneath the canvas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all these,&rdquo; Curlie said, &ldquo;old reindeer, I
thank you. They&rsquo;ll come in handy when we
take the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>He proceeded to replace all the articles and
to rebind the sled.</p>
<p>Hardly had this been accomplished than the
reindeer, who had stood all this time with head
down like a tired workhorse, suddenly sprang
into action. With a wild snort he cleared with
one leap a low willow bush and dragging the
sled after him, sprang away at a terrific speed.</p>
<p>Curlie had barely time to leap, stomach-down,
upon the sled and to grasp the rawhide rope
with both hands. He was determined not to
be left behind.</p>
<p>Scarcely realizing that his most priceless possession,
his rifle, was not on the sled, he still
clung there while he was whirled along at a
terrific gait.</p>
<p>Rocking like a rowboat in a storm the sled
took the ridges of snow as a boat would the
waves.</p>
<p>Expecting at every moment to see the sled
go over and to be forced to loose his hold, Curlie
lay prepared for any emergency.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>But the short, broad, low-runnered sled, built
for just such an emergency as this, did not turn
turtle. So, across one ridge and down it they
raced, along the side of a low, receding slope,
then across a valley they sped. Skirting a
willow clump, they crossed a narrow stream to
climb a hill again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought to let him rip and go back after my
rifle,&rdquo; the boy told himself, but, tired as he was,
hungry and sleepy too, he was still game. This
beast had challenged his power of wits and endurance;
he would stick to the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder how in time you go about it to
stop &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried shouting, but this only served to
frighten the deer into greater speed, so again
he was silent.</p>
<p>They shot down a hill. There was danger
that the sled would overtake the deer and that
they would be tumbled into a heap. To prevent
this he began using his foot as a brake. It
worked; that gave him an idea. &ldquo;Have to tire
him out,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Keep the brake on
all the time. That&rsquo;ll help.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>Digging his heel in as hard as he could, he
created a great deal of friction which in time
began to tell upon the reindeer. He traveled
with his mouth open, and his breath began to
come in hoarse pants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you!&rdquo; Curlie triumphed. &ldquo;Sorry
to do it, old boy, but it seems to be the only
way we can come to terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly and yet more slowly they traveled.
The reindeer had dropped almost to a walk
when, with a sudden spurt, he did a peculiar
thing. They were near a clump of willows.
Charging straight at these, like an ostrich hiding
his head in the sand, he buried himself in
the rustling leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Curlie, rising stiffly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
that!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said, rubbing his eyes sleepily.
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll just tie you up here and leave
you to browse on these tender willow leaves
while I have a bit of frozen fish. After that
I&rsquo;ll drag the sleeping-bag into the brush for
forty winks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>A half hour later two thin columns of vapor
rose from the willows, one from the reindeer
and one from Curlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if anyone will see them?&rdquo; Curlie
puzzled before he fell asleep. &ldquo;Well, if they
do, they do. I can&rsquo;t help it and I&rsquo;m too dead for
sleep to care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie&rsquo;s runaway reindeer had carried him
far. Hardly had he fallen asleep when two
dog teams appeared over the crest of the ridge.
This ridge, a mile away, looked down upon the
willows from which the breath of Curlie and the
reindeer arose.</p>
<p>The foremost of the two powerful dog teams
was driven by a strongly built man who ran
beside the sled. Upon the other sled rode a
second individual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; The weary dogs halted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some one camped down there.&rdquo; The man
spoke more to himself than to his companion.
&ldquo;Might mean some food.&rdquo; He looked to the
loading of his rifle. &ldquo;Might mean trouble.&rdquo;
So he stood there, apparently undecided, while
the columns of vapor continued to rise from the
willows.</p>
<p>Had Curlie Carson possessed a guardian spirit
he would beyond doubt have whispered in his
ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curlie! Curlie Carson! Awake! You are
in danger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But since he had none, he slept peacefully on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br />A KNOTTY PROBLEM</h2>
<p>Joe Marion and Jennings were facing a
problem. They had returned to their camp
after following what they thought was the
trail of some other person than Curlie. You
will remember that they had discovered the
marks of a reindeer which had apparently been
tied in the brush. This reindeer, they had concluded,
belonged to some herder who had camped
in the other clump of willows for the night. It
was in fact the very reindeer which Curlie had
found tangled in the brush. But this they did
not know. And since they did not know it they
supposed they had lost all trace of their companion
and were more than half convinced that
he had been frozen to death in the blizzard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>Now, under the circumstances, what were they
to do? They had come a long and dangerous
way to capture a man, the air outlaw. To get
his man had been Curlie&rsquo;s constant thought.
He was doubtless getting farther and farther
from them as the hours passed. They now had
meat to last them three or four days. What
should they do? Press on as rapidly as they
could, leaving Curlie to find their trail and follow
if he were still alive, or should they continue
the search for him, circling the hills and
the tundra with the dogs in the hopes of again
picking up his trail?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be still alive but with frozen feet,
unable to travel,&rdquo; suggested Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that has happened often in the Arctic!&rdquo;
said Jennings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he has his belt radiophone set,&rdquo; said
Joe thoughtfully. &ldquo;The air is quiet now. His
balloon aerial would work beautifully. Why
don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly he started. In his eager search for
his companion he had neglected the radiophone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>Now he turned his attention to it. Tuning it
to 200, their agreed wave length, he listened in
while Jennings fried caribou steak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a rare treat,&rdquo; said Jennings as he
set his teeth in a juicy morsel. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s surprising
how you can keep a liking for caribou and reindeer
meat. In &rsquo;98 we came in four or five
thousand strong over the trail from Valdez.
We each had sixteen hundred pounds of kit and
grub which cost us about four hundred dollars.
With that food and the fish and game we got,
we lived up here a year and a half. Think of
it; a year and a half on a sled load of grub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find much gold?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not many of us did. Most of us went
back to the States poorer than when we came.
That is, we did as far as money goes, but in
other ways we had gained much. We had
learned how to live without the white man&rsquo;s
luxuries. We had learned to face danger, hardship
and even death with a smile. We had
lived hundreds of miles from doctors, drugs
and nurses, and yet most of us came out of
it, brown, sturdy, hard-muscled, keen of nerve
and of mind, ready for anything that life might
hand us. That&rsquo;s the pay men get for daring a
wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sh&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe held up a warning finger. He was getting
something out of the air.</p>
<p>He knew at once that it was not Curlie speaking,
yet he felt sure it was important. It came
from the north.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steamship Torrentia. Munson, the explorer,
speaking.&rdquo; Joe thrilled at the sound of that
name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Torrentia - crushed - by ice,&rdquo; the voice
went on. &ldquo;Sinking - by - the - bow. Position
about - one - thousand - miles - due - north - of -
Flaxman - Island. All supplies - unloaded - on floating - ice
pans. Shall attempt - pole - by
plane. Later - return - by plane - to Flaxman.
Must - have - transportation - for thirty - men
from - Flaxman. Authorize - any necessary
expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The message ended, Joe sat wrapped in deep
thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how he hopes to get transportation
for thirty men from Flaxman Island. That
spot, why that&rsquo;s off the map&mdash;all but off the
earth. Nobody there. No one near. We can
help him some with our dogs if we happen to
be there when he arrives but our teams are
but a sample of what he needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought to have left dogs and a native or
two with his supplies at Flaxman,&rdquo; said Jennings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s the real point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe suddenly, &ldquo;there must
be a reindeer herd somewhere near here, otherwise
that fellow with the sled deer wouldn&rsquo;t
be wandering around so close.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably. But you can&rsquo;t be sure of it.
Those little brown folks think a lot of their
reindeer. I have known them to trail a deer that
had run away in company with wild caribou, for
more than five hundred miles. Anyway, it&rsquo;s
worth looking into. If there is a good-sized
herd close to us, the Eskimo who owns it will
have enough sled deers to bring Munson&rsquo;s whole
party out to civilization. I think we ought to
look into that at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d agree with you but for one consideration,&rdquo;
said Joe thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said Jennings sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The outlaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he got to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going north, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toward Flaxman Island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably. But what of that. What little
food he and his companion, if he has one, will
eat, won&rsquo;t amount to anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it won&rsquo;t; not if he stops at that. But
as Curlie and I have said to you before, everything
goes to indicate that he is sore at Munson;
that he&rsquo;d like to do him an injury. What
greater injury could he do him than to load
down his sled with supplies from Flaxman
Island, then touch a match to the rest? Why,
man, the whole thirty of them would starve
just as Sir John Franklin&rsquo;s hundred and fifty
men did in that same region two or three generations
ago!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if the outlaw&rsquo;s that kind of a bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows about that? The only way to
find out is to go after him. I think it&rsquo;s mighty
important that we get him and get him quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have to leave Curlie to make the
best of things, to shift for himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-l-l,&rdquo; said Joe, speaking very slowly,
&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure what we should do. Let&rsquo;s
leave that discussion until morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said Jennings as he began unlacing
his felt shoes, preparatory to creeping into his
sleeping-bag.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br />A MYSTERIOUS ATTACK</h2>
<p>After a moment of indecision the man driving
the team of powerful dogs, who, as you remember,
was standing looking down at the two
columns of vapor which marked the spot where
Curlie Carson slept, spoke to his dog team. He
had been debating the advisability of descending
the hill and entering that clump of willows.
What he now said to his dogs was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dogs leaped forward and, since he had
given them no order as to direction, they raced
away straight along the ridge and not down to
the willows.</p>
<p>A hundred yards farther on he dug his
heels in the snow as he clung to the handle of
the sled and shouted: &ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>Again he appeared to debate the question.
This time he was more prompt in his decision.</p>
<p>Again the team followed the ridge, while away
in the willow clump, all unarmed and defenseless,
Curlie Carson slept and his newly acquired
reindeer munched on at the dead willow leaves.
The deer was sleek and fat. He would have
made prime feed for the traveler&rsquo;s dogs as well
as for him and his companion. And as for
Curlie; well, perhaps the man might have rejoiced
at meeting him alone and unarmed. Of
that we shall learn more later.</p>
<p>Curlie slept longer than he had intended doing.
His weary brain and tired body yearned
for rest and once this was offered to them they
partook of it in a prodigal manner.</p>
<p>At last he awoke, to poke his head out of the
sleeping-bag and to stare up at the stars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;Ah, yes,
now I remember; in a clump of willows. I
have a mysterious reindeer but no rifle. I have
some frozen fish. This clump of willows, where
is it? Where is our camp? Joe Marion, Jennings,
where are they? Who can tell?&rdquo; He
sat up and scratched his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m here. That much is good.&rdquo; He
caught the sound of the reindeer stamping the
ground. &ldquo;So&rsquo;s the reindeer here. That is better.
Only hope I learn to drive him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did learn to drive the reindeer and that
quite speedily. He found that a long rope of
rawhide was fastened to the deer&rsquo;s halter. This
was long enough to run back to the sled. It
was, he concluded, used as a jerk-line, such as
was once employed by drivers of oxen.</p>
<p>The harness he found to be of very simple
construction. Two wooden affairs fitting closely
to the shoulders and tied together at top and
bottom with stout rawhide thongs, served as
both collar and harness. From the bottom of
these ran a broad strap which connected directly
with the sled. This strap was held up from the
ground by a second broad strap which encircled
the animal&rsquo;s body directly behind its forelegs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he told the reindeer, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going
to try it over again. We got a bad start last
time. Fact is, you were away before the
starter&rsquo;s whistle blew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, straightening out the
jerk strap, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to hold on to this. If
you get excited and speed up a little too much I&rsquo;ll
pull your head over on one side and make you
go in a circle. That&rsquo;ll slow you up. Then I&rsquo;ll
pile off the sled and dig in my heels. That
should stand you on your head. You don&rsquo;t
weigh much; not over three or four hundred.
When I&rsquo;ve put you on your head a few times I
shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if you&rsquo;d turn into a
very good, obedient little reindeer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took but three try-outs to convince the
reindeer that Curlie was not an ill-meaning sort
of fellow but that he was one who meant to
have his own way. Then, like all other creatures
who have been trained, he settled down to business
and carried his newly acquired master
wherever he wanted to go; that is, he did up to
a certain moment. After that moment things
changed and Curlie was carried straight into
trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>When he left the clump of willows Curlie
drove his reindeer up the slope to the crest
of the ridge. He did this that he might get a
better view of the surrounding country, to determine
if possible the direction in which their
former camp lay.</p>
<p>Imagine his surprise on coming to a patch
of soft, freshly blown snow at the crest of the
ridge, to find the tracks of dogs and sleds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fresh tracks!&rdquo; he whispered breathlessly,
&ldquo;not ten hours old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bent over to study these tracks. For a
moment, he examined each imprint of a dog&rsquo;s
foot in the snow, each trace of sled runner and
every footprint of the driver, then with a
sudden bound he stood up again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It is the outlaw!
Passed while I slept. Why must a fellow be
everlastingly sleeping his life away?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; he thought after a moment&rsquo;s deliberation,
&ldquo;perhaps it was just as well. What
could I have done without help and without
weapons of any kind?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>Seating himself on his sled while his reindeer
pawed deep into the snow in his search for reindeer
moss, he thought things through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe Marion and Jennings,&rdquo; he told himself,
&ldquo;will sooner or later give up their search for
me and will get back on the outlaw&rsquo;s trail. They
realize the importance of capturing him. They
are brave fellows. They will not hesitate to
undertake it without me. The surest way to
get in with them again is to stay on this trail.
Only question is, shall I turn back to meet them,
shall I camp right here, or shall I follow up the
outlaw at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some deliberation he concluded that
going back over the trail would be risky; he
might miss his companions. They might get
back on the outlaw&rsquo;s trail after he had passed
the spot on which they entered the trail. Remaining
inactive did not suit him; he was not
that kind of a boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow the outlaw,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;I
believe I&rsquo;ve got a speedier outfit than he has.
White men seldom drive reindeer, so the outlaw
won&rsquo;t suspect me even though he sees me
at a distance. I can shadow him and, even unarmed
as I am, may be able to prevent a disaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having come to this conclusion he led his
reindeer to the crest of the ridge, faced him
north, leaped upon the sled, slapped him on the
hip with the jerk rein and was away.</p>
<p>For ten miles to the crack-crack of the reindeer&rsquo;s
hoofs, he shot away over the snow. As
the keen air cut his cheek, as the low, flat sled
bobbed and bumped beneath him, Curlie thought
he had never known another such mode of
travel. Surely a reindeer, when well broken,
was the ideal steed of the Arctic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the beauty of it is,&rdquo; he told himself,
&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to go hunting out feed for
him when the day is done. He finds it for himself
under the snow. You&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, there!&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly.
&ldquo;What you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>The reindeer had suddenly paused in his
flight to sniff the air. The next instant he had
gone plunging down the snow-covered ridge.</p>
<p>This was no time to think of stopping or
turning him. Should either be accomplished,
Curlie and his sled would have gone spinning in
a circle, at last to go rolling over and over in
the snow, in which event Curlie would beyond
doubt find himself at the foot of the ridge, very
much bruised and minus both sled and reindeer.</p>
<p>The most he could do was to hold back the
sled with his foot to prevent its overtaking his
mad steed, and to allow the deer to continue in
his wild race.</p>
<p>The ridge here was long and steep. A half
mile away it ended in a forest of scrub spruce
trees which beyond doubt lined the bank of a
stream.</p>
<p>But what was this he saw as they neared the
dwarf forest?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A herd of reindeer!&rdquo; he murmured in
astonishment. &ldquo;Five hundred or a thousand
of them. Old Whitie, my friend here, smelled
them and yearned for company. So he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>What was that? From the edge of the
forest there leaped a tongue of fire, a rifle
cracked, a bullet sang over his head, then another
and another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say! Do they think I&rsquo;m a reindeer rustler?&rdquo;
he groaned. &ldquo;Want to kill me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly he dropped from the sled to hide
behind a snow bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much use,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;ll
give a fellow time to think? Maybe those fellows
are rustlers themselves and they think I&rsquo;m
an officer or something.&rdquo; His blood ran cold
at the thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br />SHIPS THAT PASS IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>Much as they regretted it, Joe Marion and
Jennings after a night&rsquo;s sleep were forced to
admit that it seemed their duty to push on over
the trail left by the outlaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t be so bad if we hadn&rsquo;t caught
Munson&rsquo;s message,&rdquo; said Joe thoughtfully. &ldquo;In
a case like this, one is obliged to consider the
highest good to the greatest number. It might
easily happen that a delay on our part at this
moment would mean the loss of Munson&rsquo;s entire
party. It would almost surely mean that if they
arrived at Flaxman Island to find their supply
depot in ashes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as for Curlie,&rdquo; added Jennings, &ldquo;if
he came out of that blizzard alive with his
rifle in hand, he&rsquo;ll take care of himself, trust
him for that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and with that hind-quarter of caribou
meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was decided that they should press on.
They had followed the trail of the outlaw for
ten miles or more when they came upon footprints
in the snow beside the trail which seemed
to indicate that the outlaw had paused in his
travel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what he stopped there for?&rdquo; said
Jennings, examining the tracks carefully.
&ldquo;From the position of his feet I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;d been
looking down the hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, c&rsquo;mon,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;The big point is,
he went straight on and we&rsquo;re following.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hundred yards farther on they came to
a place where a reindeer and sled joined the
trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer!&rdquo; said Jennings, pausing
again. &ldquo;Funny that fellow would follow the
outlaw. Looks exactly like the track made by
that other fellow when he pulled out of that
clump of willows after he&rsquo;d left his deer tied
there all night and had camped in our thicket.
Wonder if it could have been the same man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>He would have wondered still more had he
known that his companion, Curlie, was on that
sled and that each mile he traveled brought him
closer to the curly-haired young radiophone expert.</p>
<p>His wonder did grow apace when, mile after
mile, the reindeer driver followed the trail of
the outlaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what he&rsquo;s after,&rdquo; he mumbled over
and over.</p>
<p>When presently he saw the reindeer tracks
suddenly swing to the right and down the ridge,
and by straining his eyes he made out a large
herd of reindeer feeding at the edge of the
scrub forest, he was truly disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought it meant something,&rdquo; he grumbled,
&ldquo;his following along that way. But I guess he
was just following the ridge for good going till
he got to his reindeer herd. We might go down
and buy some reindeer meat. I think I see a
cabin at the edge of the forest. They might
have other things to eat, coffee, hardtack and
the like. Natives often do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t afford to use up the time,&rdquo; said Joe.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing well enough on caribou meat.
Got quite a supply of it yet. So we&rsquo;d better
mush along. All right, Ginger! Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; he
shouted. His leader leaped to his feet and they
were away.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to speculate on just
what would have happened had they decided to
descend the hill to trade with the natives. They
might have been ambushed and slain, for Curlie
Carson was at that moment in the cabin at
the edge of the forest and he was far from
free to go his own way.</p>
<p>So like ships in the night they passed, Curlie
Carson and his pals. Only once Jennings paused
to look back. Then as he shaded his eyes he
said to Joe:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like I see something hovering up
there about the tree tops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;White owl or raven,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think it is. Can&rsquo;t quite make
out what it is, though.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>Then they pressed on over the trail left by
the sleds of the outlaw.</p>
<p>The fluttering above the edge of the forest
was caused by neither white owl nor raven, but
by three balloons bobbing about in the air; a
red one, a white one and a blue one. These
balloons, considerably larger than toy balloons,
were kept from fluttering away by silk cords
reaching to the cabin below.</p>
<p>Before we can explain their presence here we
must first tell what had happened to Curlie Carson
since we left him huddled behind a snowbank
with bullets singing over him.</p>
<p>Without knowing why he had been attacked
Curlie realized that he was in grave danger.
These rough men, whoever they might be, were
apparently bent on his destruction.</p>
<p>For the moment he was safe. The snowbank
was thick and solid. A bullet, he knew, made
little progress in snow. But they might outflank
him and come in to the right or left of
him. They doubtless believed him to be in
possession of a rifle, or at least an automatic.
They would plan their attack with extreme
caution but in time they would get him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Twisting about under cover he studied the
lie of the snow to right and left of him. It
was not reassuring. True, there were other
snow ridges, but to reach these he must expose
himself. This would not do. To cut himself
a trench along the hillside would take too long.
Besides he would be detected in the attempt. He
thought of his belt radiophone equipment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might get up a balloon aerial,&rdquo; he told himself,
&ldquo;and send an S. O. S. But that would
take time&mdash;too much time. Besides, who&rsquo;d
come to my rescue? Deuce of a mess, I&rsquo;d say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He at length determined on a bold move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might get shot down on the spot,&rdquo; he admitted,
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s better than waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thing he did was to leap suddenly upon
the crest of the snowbank with his hands held
high in air, at the same time keeping a sharp
eye on the attackers. If they shot he would
instantly drop back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>They did not shoot. Their rifles went to their
shoulders but when they saw his hands in air
they hesitated.</p>
<p>After a brief consultation, two of them, with
rifles extended before them for a hip-shot,
walked slowly toward him.</p>
<p>When they were within twenty yards of him
Curlie said in the calmest tone he could command:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you fellows? I
didn&rsquo;t steal your reindeer. Found him tangled
in a thicket where he would have starved. Besides,
I have no guns. What harm could I
do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word the two men proceeded to
advance. As they came closer Curlie became
convinced that they were Indians and not
Eskimos as he had supposed them to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes it look different,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;They may be reindeer rustlers who have
stolen the reindeer herd. Probably are. Never
heard of a reindeer herd being given to Indians.
Might have, for all that. Or they may be just
herding them for some white men.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>As the two men came up to him one man felt
of his clothing for concealed weapons. After
this, with a grunt, he pointed toward the cabin,
then led the way, leaving his companion to
bring up the rear.</p>
<p>Arrived at the edge of the forest, the foremost
man joined the man who had remained
behind. After a short consultation in tones too
low to be understood, he returned to Curlie and
again motioning him to follow, led him to a
low log cabin.</p>
<p>Once inside this cabin, he pushed Curlie into
a small dark room, after which he swung to a
heavy door and dropped a ponderous bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now, what about that?&rdquo; Curlie whispered
to himself.</p>
<p>A hasty survey of his prison revealed a chair
and a rough bed made of poles on which there
rested some filthy blankets. The place was
lighted by two windows, not more than ten
inches square. The walls were of heavy logs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder who they are and who they think
I am,&rdquo; he asked himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>He sat down to think and as he did so his
arm brushed his belt. At that moment an inspiration
came to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worth trying anyway,&rdquo; he whispered as
he rose hastily. &ldquo;Have to be quick about it
though. Lucky that window&rsquo;s at the back of
the cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br />&ldquo;WE HAVE MET WITH DISASTER&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Curlie&rsquo;s fingers, working rapidly yet with
trained precision, drew various articles from his
belt. A coil of fine wire, two long spools made
of some black substance, a pocket spirit lamp,
a miniature metal retort, three small balloons
made of a specially prepared elastic fiber; all
these and many more things appeared as if by
magic, and were spread out upon a blanket on
the cot.</p>
<p>After unwinding and winding again some
yards of fine copper wire, he snapped open the
metal-cased spirit lamp and a tiny flame appeared.
Attaching a balloon to the retort he
applied the flame to the body of the retort. At
once the balloon began to expand. Chemicals
already in the retort were assuming a gaseous
form.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>Just here he found himself facing a difficulty;
the balloons were going to expand to a
size beyond that of the windows. With lightning-like
decision he climbed upon a chair and
thrust balloon, retort, spirit lamp and all out
of the window. There he held them all at arm&rsquo;s
length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be seen, but I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; he
muttered.</p>
<p>The balloon was tugging at his hand. When
the tug had grown strong he snapped on a rubber
band, withdrew the retort, tied the balloon
to a round of the chair and was at once busy
with a second balloon.</p>
<p>When all three balloons were bobbing about
outside the window he breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Attaching a spool of fine wire to a silk cord
which was tied to all three balloons, he allowed
the balloons to rise while he played out two
strands of wire. Having reached the second
spool he allowed the fine copper wire aerial
which he had thus made to rise with the balloons
until they had reached a height of three hundred
feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>A fine, insulated copper wire ran from the
aerial to the ground. This he attached to an
instrument in his belt. Having tuned in on 200
he sat down calmly to repeat in a low tone at
regular intervals:</p>
<p>&ldquo;S. O. S.&mdash;S. O. S.&mdash;S. O. S.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the only way he had been able to think
of for letting the world know he was in trouble.</p>
<p>It brought results, for soon to his waiting
ears came a gruff grumble which resembled the
growl of a bear disturbed from his slumber:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! What&rsquo;s the rumpus? What do you
want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Curlie whispered back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deputy Marshal McDonald of the U. S.
Station at Sinizols. Who the blazes are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly, distinctly, in a tense whisper Curlie
told of his predicament.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know &rsquo;em,&rdquo; came in a roar through the
air. &ldquo;They stole those deer. Don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em
know you know. When they come in let &rsquo;em
listen to me. Tell &rsquo;em who I am. They know
me. That&rsquo;ll settle &rsquo;em. Tell &rsquo;em I&rsquo;ll follow &rsquo;em
to the Pole if they don&rsquo;t let you go. No&mdash;don&rsquo;t
tell &rsquo;em. Let me. They don&rsquo;t know about
radiophones. Just got mine last week. They&rsquo;re
superstitious. It&rsquo;ll knock &rsquo;em dead. Let me
tell &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; whispered Curlie, &ldquo;keep your
batteries connected and stand by. I&rsquo;ll see what
I can find out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like the little old radio,&rdquo; he told
himself; &ldquo;nothing at all like it when you&rsquo;re in
a peck of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hanging his receiver on a nail he turned toward
the door. Placing his ear against a crack,
he listened.</p>
<p>To his surprise, he found that the men were
speaking English. &ldquo;One of them is a half-breed,
maybe of another tribe, and doesn&rsquo;t
understand the native language of the others,&rdquo;
was his mental comment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>As he now and then caught a snatch of the
conversation, his blood ran cold. There could
be no mistaking the subject of their debate.
They were discussing the question of whether
or not, he, Curlie, should be killed. The half-breed
was standing out against it, while the
others insisted that it was the only safe thing
to do. So determined were they about it and
so earnest in their debate that at times their
voices rose almost to a shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were to consult me in the matter,&rdquo;
Curlie whispered to himself, &ldquo;I would most
certainly agree with my old friend, the half-breed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as he joked with himself, the true significance
of his situation was borne more closely
in upon him. Here he was many miles from
human habitation in the heart of a wilderness.
Three men calmly debated his destruction. Two
against one; there could be no question of the
verdict.</p>
<p>Escape was impossible. The windows were
too small. The men were powerfully built;
there was no chance to fight his way to freedom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>There stood between him and death a slender
wire reaching up to two yet more slender ones
hanging in the sky. What if the gas escaped
from the balloons? What if a sudden gust of
wind sent them crashing down into the treetops
to tear and tangle his slender aerials? What if
the deputy at the other end should make some
mistake and be unable to listen in?</p>
<p>Little wonder that, as he stood there listening,
waiting, his face turned gray with anxiety and
fear.</p>
<p>In the meantime an important message had
come to Joe and Jennings as they listened in on
long wave lengths from their camp some ten
miles from the cabin. The message was from
the explorer, Munson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Munson&rsquo;s Expedition - Munson - speaking,&rdquo;
came the voice from the air. &ldquo;We - have met -
with disaster. Dash to - Pole - abandoned. Ice -
began - piling - at - four - this morning. Many
supplies - much - gasoline - lost. Will - not -
have - enough - gasoline - to - bring - planes -
to - land. One - plane - smashed. Cannot -
bring - food - only - men. If - supporting -
party - can be - sent - from - due - north - of -
Flaxman - Island - it - may save - our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>Joe Marion listened to the message as it was
repeated three times, then turned a grave face
to Jennings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s serious,&rdquo; he said after he had repeated
the message. &ldquo;I might answer it but
what could I promise him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d only give our position away to the
outlaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might try to relay the message to others
who might help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one near enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the only thing we can do is to try to
reach them with such supplies as we can carry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks that way just now,&rdquo; said Jennings,
wrinkling his brow. &ldquo;We might think of something
later. How about the outlaw? Do we
get him first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the question. We&rsquo;ll have to wait and
see. May get another message later. In the
meantime, let&rsquo;s turn in early and get a start to-morrow
before daybreak. The importance of
our mission to the north has been greatly increased.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br />A TENSE SITUATION</h2>
<p>If Curlie&rsquo;s knees trembled as he heard the
heavy bar being lifted from the door, there was
no trace of emotion on his face when at last
the door swung open and he stood facing his
three captors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome in,&rdquo; he smiled, coolly. &ldquo;I was
just thinking of calling you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been
talking to your old friend McGregor of the
U. S. Service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men started back to stare about the
small room, as if suspecting that the deputy
was hidden somewhere within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not here,&rdquo; smiled Curlie, who in spite
of the grave danger which confronted him was
enjoying the situation. &ldquo;I was just speaking to
him over the phone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Phone!&rdquo; The half-breed whispered the
words.</p>
<p>It was evident that the trio were more bewildered
than before. They had seen telephones
and telephone wires in centers of civilization
which they had visited. They knew what they
were; knew, too, that there was not a yard of
telephone wire within three hundred miles of
their cabin. As for a telephone, had they not
built this cabin? How then could it contain a
telephone without their knowing it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted the older of the two Indians.
He uttered a low laugh of contempt which
showed plainer than words that he thought
Curlie was bluffing.</p>
<p>Curlie&rsquo;s hand went to his side. He lifted a
transmitter to his lips, then touched a button at
his belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you there, McGregor?&rdquo; He pronounced
the words distinctly.</p>
<p>It was one of those periods of time in which
one lives a year in the space of a moment, a
moment tense with terrible possibilities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>Into Curlie&rsquo;s mind there flashed a score of
questions. Was McGregor there? Would he
respond? Would the Indians be frightened to
the point of giving him up if he did? Was the
slender aerial still dangling in air and still
working? These and many others sped through
his active brain as breathlessly he waited.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, with a fervently whispered,
&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he caught McGregor&rsquo;s gruff
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, here! Let me have &rsquo;em. Put &rsquo;em on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older Indian was so surprised by Curlie&rsquo;s
actions that the receiver was on his head before
he knew it.</p>
<p>The next instant his mouth sagged open, his
eyes bulged out, his knees scarcely supported
him. He was hearing McGregor&rsquo;s voice. He
did not know how nor why, but he heard. It
was enough. He was afraid.</p>
<p>For three minutes they all stood there spell-bound.
Then apparently the voice ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what do you want?&rdquo; the Indian
quavered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only my reindeer, my sled and a chance to
get away from here,&rdquo; smiled Curlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boz Peon, go get &rsquo;em.&rdquo; The Indian spoke to
the half-breed. At once he was away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, McGregor,&rdquo; Curlie breathed into
the transmitter. &ldquo;Thanks a lot. Hope I meet
you sometime. If there&rsquo;s anything further
you&rsquo;ll get my S. O. S.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to the window, he began hauling in
on the wire and silk cord. Just as the reindeer
arrived at the door, he replaced in his belt the
last bit of apparatus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All O. K. for next time,&rdquo; he whispered to
himself. &ldquo;Trust the old radiophone to pull you
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After leaving the cabin he was obliged to
lead his reindeer for the first two or three miles.
Had he not done this the deer might have rebelled
again and gone racing back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I&rsquo;d insisted on their giving me a rifle,&rdquo;
he told himself. &ldquo;Wish there was some way
of getting that reindeer herd from them,&rdquo; he
thought a few moments later. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame
that they should rob the Eskimo that way. The
reindeer are everything to the Eskimo, food,
clothing, bedding and means of travel. It&rsquo;s a
crime to rob them. Of course the rascals will
be caught and punished, but by that time the
splendid herd may be scattered to the four
winds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little did he guess the strange circumstances
under which he would see that herd again, nor
of the ways in which the herd would assist him
in carrying out the purposes which were already
forming in his mind.</p>
<p>An exclamation of joy escaped his lips as he
swung back on the trail running along the
ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re after the outlaw! Good old Jennings
and Joe! We&rsquo;ll get him yet. I&rsquo;ll catch
up with them! Hooray!&rdquo; He threw his hands
in the air and gave such a lusty shout that
the reindeer came near leaping out of his
harness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>He had discovered that while he was being
held prisoner by the Indians, Joe and Jennings
in their pursuit of the outlaw had passed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I&rsquo;ve got to do,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;is to
speed up this old white ship of the Arctic desert
and I&rsquo;ll be with them in twenty-four hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this he was mistaken, but since he did not
know it he went bumping merrily along over
the ridges. Now and then shouting at his reindeer,
now and then bursting forth into snatches
of boisterous song, he appeared filled with quite
as much joy as a boy off for a fishing trip.</p>
<p>So, for hours he traveled, until his reindeer
was in need of rest and food, then he turned off
into the edge of the scrub-spruce forest. Here,
after tethering the deer in an open spot where
there was much moss, he built himself a rude
shelter of green boughs, kindled a fire, roasted
some strips of reindeer meat procured from the
Indians, then crept into his sleeping-bag.</p>
<p>Here for a time, through a crack in his green
canopy, he watched the big dipper in its wide
circle about the north star, which blinked down
from nearly straight above him. He at last
fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>In the meantime, in a camp some distance
farther down the valley, beneath a cut-bank at
the edge of a frozen river, his two companions
were receiving a strange and startling message.
The message was once more from Munson, the
explorer. Again the expedition had met with
disaster. Having attempted the flight to shore
in their airplanes they had made but half the
distance when one of the planes became disabled
and landed, to crash into a pile of ice.
With the remaining planes much overloaded,
they had been obliged to abandon all food. Two
hundred miles from shore the gasoline had given
out. Making fortunate landings on broad ice-pans,
they had at once started on foot for shore.
They had been carried to the right by a strong
gale and would doubtless reach land some twenty
miles west of their food depot on Flaxman
Island; that is, they would land there if anywhere.
Without food they were well nigh
hopeless. Still they had two light rifles and a
hundred rounds of ammunition. There were
seals in water-holes and polar bears wandering
over the floes. There was a chance for life. If
anyone listening in on this message were in a
position to come out and meet them they might
be the instruments in saving lives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That means us,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;And it means
such a struggle as we have never experienced
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Means we leave the trail of the outlaw at
once,&rdquo; said Jennings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;uh&mdash;&rdquo; Joe stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His trail will lead us twenty miles out of
the way. Flaxman Island is twenty miles to the
east of us; these explorers are straight ahead.
We follow this stream straight to the sea.
Hard-packed river trail all the way. The outlaw,
unless I miss my guess, will turn off soon
to cut across the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t much food to take to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have our dogs,&rdquo; said Jennings grimly.
&ldquo;Men eat dogs when they are starving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe looked at his old leader, Ginger, who lay
with feet stretched out before the fire. The dog
rose, stretched himself, then walked over to
rub his cold nose against his young master.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>Joe gulped, &ldquo;Y-e-s, I suppose they do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll unload everything we don&rsquo;t need, all
the radiophone equipment except the light set,
and cache them here. Then we&rsquo;ll make a flying
trip of it. And,&rdquo; he said, noting Joe&rsquo;s discomfort
at the thought of sacrificing his faithful
four, the team that had fought with him, starved
with him and carried him so far, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got
rifles and ammunition. Who knows what game
may bob up to take the place of our dogs?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br />A MAD DREAM</h2>
<p>It was with a feeling of great astonishment
that Curlie, early in the afternoon of the next
short Arctic day, came upon the pile of radiophone
instruments and other articles which had
been piled beside the trail by his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what does this mean?&rdquo; he said, addressing
his reindeer. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be they&rsquo;ve been
ambushed and robbed. Things are piled away
too carefully for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he exclaimed a moment later,
&ldquo;they&rsquo;ve left the trail of the outlaw! Of all the
unbelievable things! What could have induced
them to do that? Can&rsquo;t be trying to outflank
him. Trail they&rsquo;ve taken is a lot longer than
his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He returned to sit down on the sled and
scratch his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Traveling light, they are. I&rsquo;d never catch
them now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he was silent for some time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish they&rsquo;d left me a rifle. I&rsquo;d go after
the outlaw single-handed. But of course they
wouldn&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t even know I&rsquo;m alive, let alone
on their trail with a reindeer. Nothing more
improbable than that. Wish I&rsquo;d risked a call to
them. Didn&rsquo;t dare, though. Outlaw&rsquo;d know we
were after him if he listened in. Now what&rsquo;s
to be done? Have to see how much radiophone
stuff they left behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time he busied himself sorting out
the parts of the heavier radiophone set and
connecting them up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All here,&rdquo; he breathed at last, &ldquo;even my
little outfit for making mince pie of a fellow&rsquo;s
speech then piecing it together again. Joe took
all the smaller set, though. That&rsquo;s good. Best
thing I can do is to camp right here and wait
until I&rsquo;m sure they must be camped for the
night. Then I&rsquo;ll send out a signal and see if
I can get them. I can talk mince meat fashion
so the outlaw won&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s about, anyway.
Got to get in touch with them some way
or another.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Realizing that after hearing from them he
might want to travel at night to make up for
lost time, after tethering out his reindeer he
crept into his sleeping-bag and, in a moment,
fell into a sound sleep.</p>
<p>When he awoke it was quite dark. Getting
busy at once with his radiophone, he sent a signal
quivering through the air.</p>
<p>He received no response.</p>
<p>A half hour later he sent out a second. Still
no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer! Mighty queer,&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;Still, they may have made rapid time
and got in ahead of the outlaw. May be close
in, too close to risk an answer. No harm to
keep on trying, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be remembered that Curlie had not
listened in on any of the messages sent by the
exploring party. As a consequence he was
totally ignorant of their plight and unable in any
way to account for his companions&rsquo; sudden
change of course.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Queer business!&rdquo; he told himself as he
prepared to send his third signal. &ldquo;Mighty
queer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every half hour for three hours he sent out
the signal. Then, just as he was about to give
it up, his receiver rattled and a succession of
short, sharp, meaningless sounds began to pour
forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Joe!&rdquo; he smiled delightedly. &ldquo;Nobody
up here can talk that language. Now we&rsquo;ll
know what&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His conclusion was correct. It was Joe speaking.
When Curlie had decoded the jumbled
message he needed only to signal back an answering
O. K. In short, concise sentences, Joe
had told him all that he needed to know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he sat down rather dizzily on
his sled, &ldquo;where does that leave me? Far as
I can see, it leaves me guardian of that food
supply until the party gets in. It&rsquo;s the best I
can do. And, unless I miss my guess, it&rsquo;s going
to be some job! I&rsquo;m to be a guard without a
gun. And the fellow I&rsquo;m going up against has
a gun, probably two or three of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few moments had elapsed, he spoke
again: &ldquo;Short day&rsquo;s journey now. No use
risking coming upon him in the night. Might
as well take another snooze and freshen up a
bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he crept into his sleeping-bag once
more, but not to sleep at once. His mind was
too full of thoughts for that. The curtain to
the crowded third act of this little drama of
life which he had been playing was, he felt sure,
about to rise. What was it to be like? What
gun-play, what struggles, what battle of wits
would be enacted upon that white and glistening
stage with no audience save the stars?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>His mind was filled with a thousand questions.
Who was the outlaw? Was he the
smuggler chieftain or was he not? What grudge
did he hold against the great explorer that he
would travel all this distance to satisfy it? Or
did he hold a grudge at all? Was he merely
coming here to winter in safety? Would he
camp by the food depot or would he destroy it?
Who was his companion? Or did he have no
companion? Had it been he who had appeared
in the mirage or had it not?</p>
<p>Who was the Whisperer? Or was there no
Whisperer? If there was such a person, was
that person a girl and was she with the outlaw
at the present time? If he succeeded in outwitting
the outlaw, would he at last meet the
Whisperer face to face?</p>
<p>All these and many more questions seething
through his brain, kept him for a long time
awake. But at last weariness conquered and
he fell asleep.</p>
<p>When, only a few hours later, he awoke, it
was with a feeling of impending danger. Before
he opened his eyes, he could hear the reindeer
thrashing about among the willows to
which he was tied in a vain attempt to break
away. When he opened his eyes it was to stare
up at a broad dome of sky which appeared to be
all on fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The food depot!&rdquo; he groaned, leaping to his
feet. &ldquo;It was closer than I thought. It&rsquo;s gone.
Burned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he exclaimed, a second later. &ldquo;No,
it&rsquo;s worse than that!&rdquo; He put his hand to his
forehead. The next instant, reeling like a
drunken man in a delirious dream, he stumbled
toward his reindeer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIII</span>
<br />&ldquo;A BEAR! A BEAR!&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In the meantime Joe Marion and Jennings
were making their way over the treacherous
ice floe toward the party of explorers who were
battling for their lives against cold, hunger and
ever perilous floes.</p>
<p>They had crossed a broad expanse of ice
which, level as a floor, lay between the shore
and a series of low, barren, sandy islands. Then
for three miles farther they had traveled over
ice which was frozen to the shore. This ice,
piled as it had been by storms of early winter
into fantastic heaps, here and there mixed with
flat cakes and with narrow, tombstone-like fragments
set on end, was nevertheless firmly united
to the shore. Over this, winding back and forth
on flat cakes and over tumbled piles of ice, they
traveled without fear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>When they came to what lay beyond this,
all was changed. They entered upon a new life
with fear and trembling. True, the ice, pressed
hard on shore by a north wind, was not at this
moment moving, yet the slow rising and falling
of a broad cake of ice here, the crumbling of a
pile there, told them that they were now far
out over the fathomless ocean; told them too
that should the wind shift to south, east or west
they might at any moment be carried out to
sea, never to be heard of again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be helped,&rdquo; Jennings said grimly, as
Joe spoke of this. &ldquo;When the lives of thirty
of Uncle Sam&rsquo;s brave citizens are at stake one
does not think of personal danger. He goes
straight ahead and does his duty. Our duty
lies out there.&rdquo; He pointed straight over the
ice floes which lay far as eye could scan, out
to sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right-o,&rdquo; said Joe as he turned to urge his
dogs forward.</p>
<p>It was hard on Joe, this urging of his faithful
four forward over the difficult trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t be so bad,&rdquo; he told them, &ldquo;if I
wasn&rsquo;t driving you straight on to your own
destruction. To think that after all this struggle
your reward is being eaten by some starving explorers.
That&rsquo;s what breaks my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, well,&rdquo; he sighed as he climbed a tumbled
pile of ice fragments, &ldquo;there may be a way
out yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Night came on, and still by the light of the
moon they fought their way forward. Every
moment counted. Their own lives as well as
the lives of those they sought to rescue were at
stake.</p>
<p>Only when the dogs, completely exhausted,
lay down in the traces and howled piteously,
begging for rest and food, did they pause and
seek a camping place for the night.</p>
<p>A broad cake of ice some hundred yards wide
from edge to edge was chosen. In the center
of this they pitched their tent. No Arctic
feathers for them that night, only the hard surface
of the ice. But even such a bed as this
was welcome after a day of heroic toil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>When the dogs had been fed and they had
eaten their own supper they set up the radiophone,
and braving the danger of being detected
by the outlaw, sought to get into communication
with the exploring party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to find out whether we are going right,&rdquo;
Joe explained.</p>
<p>In a surprisingly short time they received an
answer and were cheered by the news that their
course was correct, and that they were at this
moment not more than seventy-five miles from
the explorers. With good luck, did not the ice
floe begin to shift, they might almost hope to
meet the men they sought at the evening of
the next day and to relieve them of their suffering
from hunger.</p>
<p>After getting in touch with Curlie and rejoicing
over the knowledge that he was alive
and safe, they crept into their sleeping-bags and
speedily drifted away to the land of dreams.</p>
<p>Joe was awakened some time later to hear
old Major sawing at the chain which bound
him to his sled and barking lustily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>Before his eyes were fully open he heard a
ripping sound at the flaps of the tent. The next
instant two great round balls of fire appeared
at the gap made in the tent-wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jennings! Jennings!&rdquo; he shouted hoarsely.
&ldquo;A bear! A bear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The polar bear, attracted by the sound of
his voice, lunged forward, taking half the tent
with him.</p>
<p>Joe had scarcely time to creep back into the
depths of his sleeping bag when the bear&rsquo;s
foot came down with a thud exactly where his
head had been a second before.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>What Curlie Carson saw as he plunged toward
his reindeer there at the edge of the scrub
forest was a spectacle which might well have
staggered a person much older than himself.</p>
<p>The forest of scrub spruce was on fire. The
fire was traveling toward him, seemed, indeed,
to be all but upon him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>There was not a breath of air. The fire
traveled by leaping from tree to tree. The
very heat of it appeared to seize the dwarf
trees and, uprooting them, to hurl them hundreds
of feet in air.</p>
<p>It was such a spectacle as few are called
upon to witness. A red column of flame rose
a sheer hundred feet in air. Dry, rosiny spruce
cones and needles rose like feathers high in
air, to go rocketing away like sparks from a
volcano. The sky, the very snow all about him,
seemed on fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And near! So near!&rdquo; he muttered through
parched lips as he tore at the thong which
bound his terrified reindeer to the willow bush.</p>
<p>His thought had been to loose the reindeer,
and clinging to the sled, attempt to escape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>It was fortunate that the thong resisted his
efforts, for just as he was about to succeed in
loosing it, he caught above the tremendous roar
of the fire a strange crack-cracking. The next
instant he saw a vast herd of wild and half
tame things, all maddened by the fire, bearing
down upon him. There was just time to flash
his knife twice, to cut the thong and the sled
strap, then to leap astride the white reindeer.
Then the surge were upon him. Like a mighty
flood they surrounded him, engulfed him, carried
him forward.</p>
<p>He saw them as in a dream, reindeer by hundred,
caribou by thousands, wolves, a bear, all
struggling in a mad effort to rush down the
narrow valley from the destroying pillar of fire.</p>
<p>He saw a wolf snap at a caribou&rsquo;s heels. Saw
innumerable hoofs strike the wolf and bear him
down to sure destruction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trampled him to death,&rdquo; he shivered,
&ldquo;trampled him as they would me if I fell from
my reindeer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He clung to the deer&rsquo;s neck and to his harness
with the grim grip of death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sled&rsquo;s gone, radiophone set gone. Everything
gone but life and a reindeer. And thus
far you are lucky.&rdquo; So his mind seemed to
tell him things as he felt himself floating forward
as if on the backs of the innumerable host.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIV</span>
<br />A WILD MIX-UP</h2>
<p>Just when Joe, trapped in the sleeping-bag,
with the ponderous bear moving near him, was
wondering what had happened to Jennings, he
felt himself suddenly lifted from the ice and
shaken till his teeth rattled. Then suddenly he
went crashing upon the hard surface beneath
him.</p>
<p>He guessed well enough what had happened:
The bear had seized the sleeping-bag and having
lifted it as a cat lifts a rat, had shaken it
violently. Then the deerskin had given way beneath
Joe&rsquo;s weight and he had gone down with
a thump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What next?&rdquo; his agitated mind asked him.
&ldquo;What next?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>He could only guess at what happened next.
Inside his sleeping-bag he could see nothing.
But that something tremendous was happening
he was forced to believe.</p>
<p>From the mouth of the bear there came a
sudden sound like the hissing of a cat, and
after that such a tumbling and thrashing as he
had never heard tell of.</p>
<p>Over and over the bear appeared to roll.
There were sounds of tearing canvas and
straining ropes. Once the bear rolled across his
feet and for a second he feared he would be
lamed for life. Then suddenly the sound ceased.
He only knew one thing, which was that something
heavy rested on his sleeping-bag.</p>
<p>To realize what had really happened we must
follow Jennings as he proceeded to meet this
strange and novel situation. Being more fortunate
than Joe, he had succeeded in wriggling
from his sleeping-bag and in grasping his rifle
before the bear saw him. He had been engaged
in the business of getting a bead on the bear&rsquo;s
ponderous head when there came a sudden tearing
at the ropes of the tent. The next instant it
doubled up and came flapping down upon him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>If you are able to imagine what it might be
like to be caught in a net with a whale, you
have some notion of Jennings&rsquo; position at this
time. The tent had enveloped both him and
the bear. Together they rolled over and over.
One moment it seemed he would be crushed to
death and the next, as an opening appeared, a
new rent in the canvas, it seemed that he might
be freed.</p>
<p>At last, with a mighty effort, he wrenched
himself loose and, much to his own astonishment,
found that he still grasped his rifle in his
left hand.</p>
<p>The bear was still thrashing about. Joe was
still buried beneath the tent. Jennings was
just trying to figure out the next move, when he
heard one of the dogs let out a wild ki-yi-yi of
fright.</p>
<p>Wheeling about, he saw a huge bear grasping
a dog by the middle of the back with his teeth
and attempting to carry him away. Since the
dog was chained to a sled and six other dogs
were also chained to that sled, it was necessary
for him to drag the sled and six very reluctant
dogs after him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be funny if it wasn&rsquo;t serious,&rdquo; said Jennings
grimly as he took steady aim at the beast&rsquo;s
head. Three times his automatic rifle barked.
The bear crumpled up in a heap.</p>
<p>There was, however, not a second to be
wasted. As he turned he found himself staring
at a towering white apparition. This apparition,
which stood some three feet above his
head, had red gleaming eyes and a lolling
tongue. The second bear had escaped from the
tent. Angered by his experience and the death
of his companion, he was ready for battle with
these strange invaders of his domain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want satisfaction, do you?&rdquo; said Jennings
grimly. &ldquo;Well! There! Take it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a movement that for speed and accuracy
could not be beaten, he thrust the muzzle of his
rifle at the base of the beast&rsquo;s skull and fired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>Thus a second bear had just been bagged by
Jennings when Joe came creeping out of his
sleeping-bag. For a few seconds he sat rubbing
his shins. Then suddenly his face lightened
with a smile as he sang out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We killed the bear! Betsy and I killed the
bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway,&rdquo; smiled Jennings, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
going to have one of your dearest wishes
granted. Your old dorgs, Ginger, Pete, Major
and Bones, won&rsquo;t have to be fed to the starvin&rsquo;
explorers. Here&rsquo;s a day&rsquo;s rations for a regiment
of soldiers. I bet that big bear weighs a ton
and a half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoop-ee!&rdquo; cried Joe springing to his feet
and rushing over to embrace his astonished
friend, Ginger. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s sure good news to us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixteen inches between the ears,&rdquo; pronounced
Jennings after measuring with his
hands the skull of the fallen Goliath of the
North. &ldquo;Some bear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some bear, I&rsquo;d say!&rdquo; echoed Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a day&rsquo;s work to be done on the
tent,&rdquo; said Jennings. &ldquo;He ripped it up something
awful. But we&rsquo;ll have to make it do at
least till we meet Munson.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and till we get ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess so. Lend a hand and let&rsquo;s see what
shift we can make for a wink more of sleep
before we march on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few moments Joe and Jennings were
curled up in their sleeping-bags, snoring as if
they were safe in bed at home.</p>

<br />THE WILD STAMPEDE</h2>
<p>At no time in Curlie Carson&rsquo;s adventurous
life had he experienced such strangely mingled
emotions as he did while riding astride the white
reindeer in the midst of the wild stampede. A
sea of tossing antlers was all about him. Behind
him was the red glare of a mountain of
flame. What the next moment would bring
forth he could not even guess. Now the mass
of struggling life was crowded into a narrow
runway between banks of a river and now they
spread out over an open flat. Now his legs
were pinched and bruised by antlers pressed
against them, and now he rode almost alone.
But always his white steed plunged on into the
night made light as day by the great conflagration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our hope is in the open tundra, open, treeless
tundra,&rdquo; he told himself over and over.</p>
<p>The great horde of creatures, seeming to
know this by instinct, headed straight for it.
Now he could see the tundra&rsquo;s broad, white expanse
gleaming before them. Would they make
it? The fire was gaining upon them. He felt
the hot breath of flame upon his cheek. The
crowding from behind became all but unbearable.
Beside him, mouth open, panting, raced a
monstrous caribou. Before him crashed a
spotted reindeer.</p>
<p>Would they make it? Now they were a half
mile from safety, now a quarter. The smell of
burning hair came stiflingly from the rear.</p>
<p>And now the foremost of the pack reached
the open tundra. Then, like a swollen stream
which has suddenly broken through its barriers,
they spread out, racing still, over the silent
glistening expanse of white prairie-like tundra.
&ldquo;A few of the weaker ones have perished. The
great mass of this wild life is saved,&rdquo; was
Curlie&rsquo;s mental comment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>A mile from the flames Curlie dropped stiffly
from his place on the reindeer&rsquo;s back and, patting
his head in grateful appreciation, tied him
with a loose rope to a willow bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;feed up a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reindeer began digging in the snow for
moss, while Curlie climbed a near-by knoll to
have a look at the strange spectacle.</p>
<p>As each wild creature pursued his own course,
Curlie looked on with interest. The wolves
were the first to slink away. The bear, a huge
barren-ground grizzly, climbed a distant hill,
there to suck his sore paws and nurse his grievances.</p>
<p>The caribou began passing to right and left
like some army ordered to deploy and, in an
astonishingly brief space of time, had all disappeared.</p>
<p>Only the reindeer, five hundred to a thousand
in number, remained to feed peacefully upon the
moss of the tundra.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Curlie said to himself, &ldquo;it seems
I&rsquo;ve come into possession of a reindeer herd!
Don&rsquo;t see&rsquo;s they have any masters. No men in
sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a dog barked. It was answered by
a second one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dogs!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Two of them.
That&rsquo;s interesting. Wonder what kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Putting two fingers to his lips, he sent out a
shrill whistle. A moment later two beautiful
collies came racing up to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Collies!&rdquo; he cried in great joy, &ldquo;reindeer
collies. Why, here I am all set up in business,
with a herd of reindeer and collies to help herd
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down to think. This was undoubtedly
the herd which had been held by the Indians.
Had the fire caught them unawares and had
they been burned alive? Or had they set the
fire in the hope of concealing their theft of
the reindeer?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re still alive and did not set the
fire,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll be along after the
fire dies down and there&rsquo;ll be more trouble. On
the other hand, if I could take some of these
deer out upon the ice floe to meet Joe and the
explorers, it would be a great boon to them.
Plenty of meat, the right kind too. It might
save their lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s the outlaw!&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly.
&ldquo;Got to settle him first. He can&rsquo;t&mdash;why
he can&rsquo;t be more than eight or ten miles
from the food depot on Flaxman Island. A
brisk morning&rsquo;s walk, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After careful deliberation he decided to
mount his reindeer and ride directly for the
shore of the island. The island would be solidly
connected to the shore by the ocean ice. He
would search out the depot and ride boldly up
to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;no man who
plots mischief is going to be afraid of an unarmed
boy riding a reindeer. Hope I can
catch him unawares and steal a march on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having put his plan into action, his faithful
reindeer and he soon went racing away over
the tundra. Coming to the shore of the island,
in order to reach the north shore where the
food depot was placed he began skirting it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>The ice was everywhere smooth as a floor and
covered with just enough snow to give the reindeer
good footing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would be a regular lark if it wasn&rsquo;t so
dangerous. This marching right up to a man
you have followed for thousands of miles is not
what it&rsquo;s cracked up to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A high cut-bank hid the food depot, a long,
low building, from his sight until he was all
but upon it.</p>
<p>As he rounded the point of the cut-bank he
saw a man, whose back was turned to him, disappear
around the northwest corner of the
building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he see me?&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll play
he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastily wheeling his reindeer about, he retreated
to the shelter of the cut-bank.</p>
<p>Here after a moment&rsquo;s thought he tied the
reindeer to an out-cropping willow root, then,
on hands and knees, crept back to the corner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>Peeping around the point, he stood at strained
attention. He saw no one, heard no one. &ldquo;And
yet he might be spying at me,&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;Got to risk it, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he leaped to his feet and dashed full
speed toward the cabin. The distance was two
hundred yards. His heart beat madly. Would
he be shot down before he reached that shelter?</p>
<p>Now he had covered half the distance, now
two-thirds, now three-quarters. That his footsteps
might not be heard, he was now running
on tiptoes. With his breath coming in short
gasps, he leaped to a corner of the cabin, threw
himself upon the snow close to the wall and
was for the moment safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much, so good,&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;Now if
only he doesn&rsquo;t see me first.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXVI</span>
<br />THE SPARKLE OF DIAMONDS</h2>
<p>Just as Joe and Jennings had finished their
breakfast of polar bear meat and were preparing
to go forward, the broad cake of ice on
which they had camped gave a sudden lurch,
then rose to such an angle as threatened to pitch
them all into a yawning gap of black water.</p>
<p>Joe sprang forward. The dogs howled dismally.
Only Jennings kept his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if that&rsquo;s the beginning of a
break-up?&rdquo; he said, wrinkling his brow. &ldquo;If
it is, every man-buck of that exploring party&rsquo;s
lost and we&rsquo;ll be doin&rsquo; fine if we escape ourselves.
It&rsquo;s a tremendous affair when this ice
gets to pilin&rsquo;. Big cakes, wide as a city lot
and thick as a one-story house, climb on top of
each other like kittens playin&rsquo; with a yarn ball.
What&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s chance in a mess like that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>There was, however, no thought of turning
back. As long as there was a chance of saving
Munson&rsquo;s party their duty lay straight
ahead. Only one part of their plans was
changed. It was decided that they would pack
their dogs as burros are packed on mountain
trails and that until the return trip their sled
should be abandoned.</p>
<p>It was a strange procession that started out
over the roughly piled ice. Jennings, with a
bulky sleeping-bag strapped to his back, led the
way. He was followed by a long line of dogs.
On each dog&rsquo;s back was securely fastened a
long strip of meat. Joe brought up the rear with
the other sleeping-bag.</p>
<p>Had an airplane passed over them as they
moved forward, its pilot might have seen what
seemed some huge brown worm wriggling its
way in and out among the ice piles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>To their great relief the ocean staged no
more demonstrations. The ice remained motionless.
All day, guided by a compass, they
made their way forward. Far into the night
they traveled. Two hours after midnight they
ate and rested, then again pushed forward.</p>
<p>Just as the tardy sun was rising, they heard
a shot in the distance and, to their great joy,
found themselves a few moments later being
cheered lustily by the worn-out and starving
explorers.</p>
<p>Soon, over a fire of bear fat, caribou meat
was roasting.</p>
<p>When, an hour later, they started back over
the trail it was with high hopes of reaching
shore in safety. Yet many a mile of treacherous
ice lay between them and that coveted goal.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>The sight which met Curlie Carson&rsquo;s gaze as
he finally mustered up courage to creep up to
the corner of the food depot building and peer
around it, made his blood boil hot with anger.</p>
<p>Before him, crouching over and placing the
last contributions to a huge bonfire of excelsior,
paper and packing-boxes piled against the building,
was the outlaw.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guessed right,&rdquo; Curlie told himself, &ldquo;and
just in time. A moment more and the thing
would have been done, the house all aflame. He
means to burn it, but he won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A second glance showed him the outlaw&rsquo;s sled
piled high and his dog team grouped about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready to race away,&rdquo; he breathed as he
tightened his muscles for a spring.</p>
<p>It was a desperate chance. Three paces from
the man a rifle leaned against the cabin. The
man was between Curlie and the rifle. There
was not a moment to lose.</p>
<p>With a snarl like a tiger Curlie sprang for
the other&rsquo;s back. They went crashing to the
snow in a heap.</p>
<p>The struggle was brief and terrific. When
they broke their hold Curlie was bruised and
bleeding but he had gained a point&mdash;an all
important point. He was now between the man
and his rifle.</p>
<p>Quicker than a cat, he sprang for it and the
next instant aimed it square at the other&rsquo;s
breast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>With a wild cry of terror the man turned and
fled toward the shore where ice was piled in
jagged heaps.</p>
<p>Still panting from his recent struggle, Curlie
followed him slowly. He was examining the
rifle. It was of a new design, totally unknown
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good thing he didn&rsquo;t know I couldn&rsquo;t fire
it,&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;They say what you don&rsquo;t
know don&rsquo;t hurt you. Well, that&rsquo;s one time it
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s struggle he discovered the
rifle&rsquo;s secret. He smiled as he walked out upon
the ocean&rsquo;s ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thinks he can hide from me. Guess he
failed to notice that in this still, cold air one&rsquo;s
breath rises far above him. He&rsquo;ll have to
stop breathing if he wishes to escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked straight toward a high ice-pile and
a moment later had the pleasure of seeing a
dark object dart away from it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I could shoot him,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Deserves
it too. Trying to burn those supplies and
leave thirty men to freeze and starve! Wonder
why he did it? I&rsquo;ll find out. I&rsquo;ll tire him out,
then capture him. After that I&rsquo;ll ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he never did.</p>
<p>The game of hide-and-go-seek had lasted for
two hours, when the man pursued started
straight across a broad expanse of ice which
was smooth as a floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That looks dangerous&mdash;looks like new ice,&rdquo;
gasped Curlie as he threw himself flat down
upon it.</p>
<p>With his sheath knife he hacked at it until
a stream of water came bubbling up and he
heard the wild rush of the current that raced
on beneath it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more than half an inch thick!&rdquo; he
breathed to himself.</p>
<p>The next instant he was on his feet, backing
off the ice and shouting: &ldquo;Hey! Hey, there!
Danger! Danger! Thin ice! Dan&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not complete the last word, for just
at that minute there came a wild shout of
despair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Splitting from end to end, the ice caved in
at the middle. For a moment the man clung to
the edge, then the current seized him.</p>
<p>Just before he disappeared his right hand
went up and a shower of &ldquo;sparks,&rdquo; which glimmered
and glistened like stars, went shimmering
away across the dark water to light upon a
broad stretch of ice which had not broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diamonds!&rdquo; breathed Curlie. &ldquo;Diamonds
and rubies from Russia! He was the smuggler
chief. Wonder why he threw them that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question had no answer. Yet, there they
lay, thousands of dollars worth of jewels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of a fellow&rsquo;s reach for the present,&rdquo;
Curlie told himself, &ldquo;but I guess if the ice
doesn&rsquo;t break up any more for a day or two it
will be easy to come out and pick them out of
the ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;I must get in
some quick work in behalf of our friends, the
explorers. With a whole reindeer herd at my
disposal I ought to be able to do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked away for a hundred yards, then
paused to look back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;tough to be
blinked out like that. No question he deserved
it, but there&rsquo;s so much bad in the best of us that
we can well afford to feel a lot of pity for the
worst of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this he turned and hurried away toward
the shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXVII</span>
<br />DIAMONDS AND OTHER THINGS</h2>
<p>Joe Marion found that five members of the
exploring party had had their feet so badly
frozen that they were unable to walk. To carry
these over the piled and tumbled ice to the spot
where the sleds had been cached was no mean
task. At the same time there was every possible
need for speed. An unfavorable wind at this
time would mean certain death to all of them.</p>
<p>They started out bravely and toiled on for
many hours, without food. When they did
pause, there was only one kind of food left to
them&mdash;polar bear meat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;About the worst kind of meat there is in
the world,&rdquo; sighed the great explorer as he tried
to roast a bit of it over a blubber fire. &ldquo;The
only way you can get any real satisfaction out
of it is to chew a piece of it till your jaws are
tired, then swallow it part way down. When
your jaws are rested, cough it up and start
chewing all over again. When you have repeated
this about four times it may go all the
way down and stay down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all laughed at this plan of procedure,
but found on trying the meat that it was indeed
the toughest proposition they had ever tackled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a bit off the neck of an old bull,&rdquo; was
Jennings&rsquo; comment.</p>
<p>When they had rested for a time they again
turned their faces shoreward to resume their
march against death.</p>
<p>In the meantime, on shore Curlie had made
his way back to the reindeer herd. A careful
study of the deer convinced him that certain of
them were sled deer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got their antlers half cut off; just stubs
left,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Stands to reason that
the Eskimo cut them off so they&rsquo;d travel lighter
in harness.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>Making a packing rope into a lasso, he succeeded
in catching one of these deer by the stubs
of his antlers. The marks of a harness told him
he was right about these sled deer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just catch three of them and tie them to
old Whitie. Then I&rsquo;ll lead all four out to meet
Joe and the explorers. They&rsquo;ll be glad enough
to have some fresh reindeer meat. We&rsquo;ll make
these three into venison, but not old Whitie!
Never! He&rsquo;s been my pal through too many
narrow escapes. He&rsquo;s going to live to tell the
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some ten hours later, as the exploring party,
weakened by lack of proper food, struggled forward
over the tumbled ice, they were surprised
to see the stubby antlers of a white sled deer
appear around an ice pile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reindeer!&rdquo; someone shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reindeer and Curlie Carson!&rdquo; exclaimed
Joe, fairly overcome with joy at meeting his old
pal after so long a lapse of time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>Three hours later, having struggled forward
to the safe and solid shore-ice, the whole party
sat down to a real feast of reindeer steak, while
a little distance away, chained to their sled,
Major, the old guard, sent out short woof-woofs
in the direction of old Whitie, and Pete, the
huskie, who was nine-tenths wolf, sawed at his
chain and ki-yied his desire to leap at the
reindeer&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>When they had finished, and had made such
shift as they could for a night&rsquo;s rest before
making the remaining twenty-five miles to the
food depot on Flaxman Island, Joe and Curlie
sat long upon an overturned sled talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you think it was the smuggler chief?&rdquo;
said Joe as Curlie finished telling of his adventure
at the food depot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have been. Look at the diamonds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think we can get them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, say, how about the Whisperer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t see a sign of any such person. Guess
she was just a hoax&mdash;never existed at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure about that. I think she must
be a real person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when we get back there on Flaxman
Island we&rsquo;ll look around.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>They arrived at the food depot next day. As
soon as the exploring party had been made comfortable,
Joe and Curlie set out to solve two
problems, the problem of the Whisperer and that
of saving the rubies and diamonds.</p>
<p>The question of the Whisperer was soon
settled, or at least they believed it was, for,
leading away from the island, they found a
three days&rsquo; old sled track. The sled had been
drawn by eight powerful dogs. There were no
human footprints beside the sled track.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saw what happened to the outlaw and
skipped,&rdquo; was Joe&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and if I had had time to look about
I might have stopped her,&rdquo; Curlie lamented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you have wanted to do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seems to be a pretty good sort; never
did us anything but good. Though how she
came to be traveling with that rascal is more
than I can guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s gone. How about our diamonds?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>Curlie led the way to the spot of the tragedy.
There had been no snow. The spot was not
hard to find. As Curlie had expected, the ice
had frozen to a depth of six or eight inches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where are the diamonds?&rdquo; he exclaimed
as he failed to catch any gleam from them.</p>
<p>A thorough search revealed not a single stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the Whisperer came back and got
them,&rdquo; suggested Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t. The ice was too thin then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Joe bent over to examine a hole the
size of a lead pencil in the ice. Bending over he
chipped away at the ice for a second, then,
straightening up, gave out a wild shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoopee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held in his hand a splendid solitaire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Melted its way into the ice,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>A careful search revealed other such holes.
After two hours the boys had succeeded in
securing twenty-eight stones.</p>
<p>When they felt they had rescued the last one,
they turned toward camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re rich,&rdquo; laughed Joe. &ldquo;Twenty thousand
dollars worth of cut stones and fifty thousand
worth of reindeer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rich for a day,&rdquo; Curlie laughed back. &ldquo;The
stones we must turn in to the customs department
and the reindeer herd must be restored to
its rightful owners. I must get McGregor, the
deputy, on the air at once and find out about
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three weeks later the two boys were once
more on the Valdez Glacier, just one day&rsquo;s journey
from the port where they might catch a
boat for Seattle and the great &ldquo;Outside.&rdquo; Their
adventures on the Yukon Trail were about at
an end.</p>
<p>One question remained unsolved: Who was
the Whisperer and where was she? It had been
established as a fact that the outlaw was the
leader of the band of smugglers. Since he had
been deprived of his illegal gains by the loyal
action of Munson, the explorer, in breaking up
his band, he had planned a cruel revenge&mdash;that
of destroying his supply station and leaving him
with his faithful companions to starve.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>Curlie&rsquo;s prompt action had averted the catastrophe,
but where was the driver of that powerful
dog team that had left the supply cabin, and
where now could she be?</p>
<p>Curlie was seated in the tent, nodding over
his radiophone instruments and thinking of this
problem and many other things. He remembered
the gratitude of the Eskimo upon the
return of the stolen reindeer herd, thought too
of the frank praise of the explorer, Munson,
when he had parted with him on the trail to
Dawson. The jewels had gone with Munson to
Dawson. So all matters were cleared up and
Curlie was ready for some new undertaking.</p>
<p>In the corner of the tent Joe Marion was
having a last romp with his &ldquo;faithful four,&rdquo;
Ginger, Pete, Major and Bones. To-morrow he
would return them to the owner from whom
they had been hired in Valdez.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said, a suspicious huskiness
creeping into his voice, &ldquo;I once heard an
old sourdough musher say that of all the things
he had in the Arctic, he hated most to part with
his dogs. I laughed at him then, but now I
know it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered Curlie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer,
but you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off suddenly. His nose began wiggling
like that of a rabbit eating clover. He
was getting something from the air. That something
was a whisper, the whisper of the Whisperer.
It said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello - Curlie - are - you - there? You -
didn&rsquo;t - see - me - there - up - at - the - top - of -
the - world - on the shore - of - the Arctic - did
you? I thought - you - had - better - not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But - Curlie - they - want - you - on the -
trail - that - leads - over - the - Great - American -
Desert. Big - things - Curlie - I heard -
them - calling - you. You may - see - me -
there - for - that - is - my - home - and I - am -
going - back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whisper ended. Curlie sat staring into
space, thinking: &ldquo;Is the Whisperer a real person
or only a ghostly spirit of the air?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>Almost as if in answer to the question came
a call from the station at Valdez, a relayed
message telling him to report for duty on the
American Desert at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he breathed as he mopped his
brow, &ldquo;I may solve that mystery yet.&rdquo;</p>
